CSAT draws on\\nthe experience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative\\nexperts to produce the TIPs, which are distributed to facilities and indi-\\nviduals across the country. The audience for the TIPs is expanding\\nbeyond public and private treatment facilities to include practitioners in\\nmental health, criminal justice, primary care, and other health care and\\nsocial service settings.\\nCSATís Knowledge Application Program (KAP) expert panel, a distin-\\nguished group of experts on substance use disorders and professionals in\\nsuch related fields as primary care, mental health, and social services,\\nworks with the State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors to generate \\ntopics for the TIPs. Topics are based on the fieldís current needs for\\ninformation and guidance.\\nAfter selecting a topic, CSAT invites staff from pertinent Federal \\nagencies and national organizations to be members of a resource panel\\nthat recommends specific areas of focus as well as resources that should\\nbe considered in developing the content for the TIP . These recommenda-\\ntions are communicated to a consensus panel composed of experts on the\\ntopic who have been nominated by their peers. This consensus panel\\nparticipates in a series of discussions. The information and recommen-\\ndations on which they reach consensus form the foundation of the TIP .\\nThe members of each consensus panel represent substance abuse treat-\\nment programs, hospitals, community health centers, counseling pro-\\ngrams, criminal justice and child welfare agencies, and private practi-\\ntioners.

Medication-assisted\\ntreatment for opioid addiction (MAT) has been effective in facilitating\\nrecovery from opioid addiction for many patients.\\nThis TIP provides a detailed description of MAT, especially in opioid\\ntreatment programs (OTPs). MAT includes optional approaches such as\\ncomprehensive maintenance treatment, medical maintenance treatment,\\ndetoxification, and medically supervised withdrawal. Some or all of\\nthese approaches can be provided in OTPs or other settings. With the\\napproval of buprenorphine for physicianís office-based opioid treat-\\nment, MAT availability is expected to increase.\\nGrowing understanding and acceptance of opioid addiction as a \\ntreatable medical disorder have facilitated advances in MAT. The \\neffectiveness of MAT advanced significantly with the development of\\nmethadone maintenance treatment in the 1960s and the creation and\\nexpansion of publicly funded treatment programs in the 1970s. The first\\nofficial Federal use of the term ìmaintenance treatmentî (referring to\\nopioid addiction treatment) occurred in the Narcotic Addict Treatment\\nAct of 1974. Perhaps the most important development in MAT during\\nthe 1990s was publication of recommendations by a National Institutes\\nof Health consensus panel on Effective Medical Treatment of Opiate\\nAddiction. The panel concluded that opioid addiction is a treatable med-\\nical disorder and explicitly rejected notions that addiction is self-induced\\nor a failure of willpower. The panel called for a commitment to providing\\neffective treatment for opioid addiction and for Federal and State efforts\\nto reduce the stigma attached to MAT and to expand MAT through\\nincreased funding and less restrictive regulation. The implementation of\\nan accreditation system for OTPs further serves to standardize and\\nimprove MAT.\\nxvii'),\n",

These\\nphases are conceptualized as parts of a dynam-\\nic continuum of patient progress toward\\nintended treatment outcomes. Each patient\\nprogresses according to his or her capacity and\\nneeds. After an orientation to introduce\\npatients to the program, successive treatment\\nphases include (1) the acute phase, during\\nwhich patients attempt to eliminate illicit-opioid\\nuse and lessen the intensity of other problems\\nassociated with their addiction, (2) the rehabili-\\ntative phase, during which patients continue to\\naddress addiction while gaining control of other\\nmajor life domains, (3) the supportive-care\\nphase, during which patients maintain their\\nabstinence while receiving other interventions\\nwhen needed, (4) the medical-maintenance\\nphase, during which patients are committed to\\ncontinuing pharmacotherapy for the foresee-\\nable future but no longer rely on other OTP\\nservices, (5) the tapering and readjustment\\nphase, an optional phase in which patients\\ngradually reduce and eliminate opioid treat-\\nment medication, and (6) the continuing-care\\nphase, in which patients who have tapered\\nfrom treatment medication continue regular\\ncontact with their treatment program.

It explains how a comprehensive treat-\\nment program improves patient retention in\\ntreatment and the likelihood of positive treat-\\nment outcomes. Patients who receive regular,\\nfrequent, integrated psychosocial and medical\\nservices along with opioid pharmacotherapy\\noften realize better outcomes than those who\\nreceive only limited services. Counseling \\nservices are integral to comprehensive mainte-\\nnance treatment and can be behavioral,\\npsychotherapeutic, or family oriented.\\nStrategies that target relapse prevention also\\nshould be part of any comprehensive treatment\\nprogram.

These patients often exhibit \\nbehaviors or experience emotions that inter-\\nfere with treatment and require special \\ninterventions. The chapter describes the\\nprevalence of co-occurring disorders, \\nscreening and diagnosis of these disorders,\\nand the effects of such disorders on treatment\\noutcomes.

Injection drug use-associated exposure accounts for approxi-\\nmately one-third of all AIDS cases diagnosed in the United States\\nthrough 2003 (National Center for HIV , STD and TB Prevention 2005)\\nand for many cases of hepatitis C (National Institute on Drug Abuse\\n2000; Thomas 2001). In the criminal justice system, people who use\\nheroin account for an estimated one-third of the $17 billion spent each\\nyear for legal responses to drug-related crime. Indirect costs from lost\\nproductivity and overdose also are high (Mark et al. 2001), and people\\nwith opioid addictions and their families experience severe reductions in\\ntheir quality of life. The increasing abuse of prescription opioids is\\nanother major concern, both for their damaging effects and as gateway\\ndrugs to other substance use (see chapter 2).\\nPurpose of This TIP\\nThis Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) is a guide to medication-\\nassisted treatment for opioid addiction (MAT) in opioid treatment \\nprograms (OTPs). Compared with MAT in other settings, such as physi-\\nciansí offices or detoxification centers, treatment in OTPs provides a\\nmore comprehensive, individually tailored program of medication \\ntherapy integrated with psychosocial and medical treatment and support\\nservices that address most factors affecting each patient.

For decades, studies have supported\\nthe view that opioid addiction is a medical dis-\\norder that can be treated effectively with medi-\\ncations administered under conditions consis-\\ntent with their pharmacological efficacy, when\\ntreatment includes comprehensive services,\\nsuch as psychosocial counseling, treatment for\\nco-occurring disorders, medical services, voca-\\ntional rehabilitation services, and case manage-\\nment services (e.g., Dole and Nyswander 1967;\\nMcLellan et al. 1993). \\nDole (1988, p. 3025) described the medical\\nbasis of methadone maintenance as follows:\\nThe treatment is corrective, normaliz-\\ning neurological and endocrinologic\\nprocesses in patients whose endogenous\\nligand-receptor function has been\\nderanged by long-term use of powerful\\nnarcotic drugs. Why some persons who\\nare exposed to narcotics are more \\nsusceptible than others to this derange-\\nment and whether long-term addicts\\ncan recover normal function without\\nmaintenance therapy are questions for\\nthe future. At present, the most that\\ncan be said is that there seems to be a\\nspecific neurological basis for the com-\\npulsive use of heroin by addicts and\\nthat methadone taken in optimal doses\\ncan correct the disorder.\\nSimilarities to other medical\\ndisorders\\nMcLellan and colleagues (2000) compared basic\\naspects of substance addiction with those of\\nthree disordersóasthma, hypertension, and\\ndiabetesówhich universally are considered\\nìmedicalî and usually chronic and relapsing\\nand for which behavioral change is an impor-\\ntant part of treatment. They found that genet-\\nic, personal-choice, and environmental factors\\nplayed comparable roles in the etiology and\\ncourse for these disorders and that rates of\\nrelapse and adherence to medication were simi-\\nlar, although substance addiction often was\\ntreated as an acute, not chronic, illness. Their\\nreview of outcome literature showed that, as\\nwith the other disorders, substance addiction\\nhas no reliable cure but that patients who com-\\nply with treatment regimens have more favor-\\nable outcomes. Fewer than 30 percent of\\npatients with asthma, hypertension, or diabetes\\nadhered to their medication regimens, pre-\\nscribed diets, or other changes to increase their\\nfunctional status and reduce their risk of symp-\\ntom recurrence. As a result, 50 to 70 percent\\nexperienced recurrent symptoms each year to\\nthe point of requiring additional medical care\\nto reestablish remission.\\nAnother similarity found between opioid \\naddiction and these medical disorders was their\\noutcome predictors (McLellan et al. 2000).

For example, Woody and\\nCacciola (1994) found that the risk of relapse\\nfor a person who was opioid addicted was high-\\nest during the first 3 to 6 months after cessa-\\ntion of opioid use. This risk declined for the\\nfirst 12 months after cessation and continued to\\ndecrease but at a much slower rate. Results\\nfrom other posttreatment studies indicated that\\nroughly 80 percent of patients who are opioid\\naddicted but leave MAT resume daily opioid\\nuse within 1 year after leaving treatment (e.g.,\\nMagura and Rosenblum 2001).\\nSimilar to patients with other chronic disorders,\\nmany who are opioid addicted have been found\\nto respond best to treatment that combines\\npharmacological and behavioral interventions.\\nAs detailed throughout this TIP , treatment of\\nopioid addiction with maintenance medication,\\nalong with other treatment services for related\\nproblems that affect patientsí motivation and\\ntreatment compliance, increases the likelihood\\nof cessation of opioid abuse. Conversely, dis-\\ncontinuation of maintenance medication often\\nresults in dropout from other services and a\\nreturn to previous levels of opioid abuse, with\\nits accompanying adverse medical and psycho-\\nsocial consequences (Ball and Ross 1991). Entry\\ninto comprehensive maintenance treatment pro-\\nvides an opportunity to prevent, screen for, and\\ntreat diseases such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B\\nand C, and tuberculosis (see chapter 10) and to\\nincrease compliance with medical, psychiatric,\\nand prenatal care (Chaulk et al. 1995;\\nUmbricht-Schneiter et al. 1994). Recent data on\\nbuprenorphine indicate that treatment with this\\nmedication, like methadone, has similar positive\\noutcomes (CSAT 2004a; Johnson et al. 2000;\\nKakko et al. 2003).\\nViewing opioid addiction as a medical disorder\\nis consistent with the idea that treatment of\\neven severe cases improves outcomes, just as in\\nother chronic and relapsing medical disorders,\\neven before abstinence is achieved. For \\nexample, Metzger and colleagues (1998) found\\nthat substance abuse treatment was associated\\nwith a significantly lower risk of HIV infection \\nthan was nontreatment. Treatment also was\\nassociated with a significant reduction, but not\\nnecessarily cessation, of drug use for many\\nindividuals. Similar findings on the positive\\nhealth outcomes associated with maintenance\\ntreatment of opioid addiction, regardless of\\nwhether abstinence was attained, were seen in\\nstudies finding that methadone maintenance\\ndecreases overdose death. Data on benefits of\\npartial responses to maintenance treatment\\nresemble the benefits of treatment for other\\nchronic medical disorders in terms of symptom\\nalleviation. An analogy with MAT would be the\\ndesirability of reducing the risk of HIV infec-\\ntion, overdose, and the many psychosocial\\ncomplications of addiction, which is not as\\ndesirable as the benefits of attaining complete\\nabstinence from opioids but is associated \\nwith significantly improved patient health and \\nwell-being. The goal is always reducing or \\neliminating the use of illicit opioids and other\\nillicit drugs and the problematic use of pre-\\nscription drugs.\\nThe medical community recognizes that opioid\\naddiction is a chronic medical disorder that\\ncan be treated effectively with a combination of\\nmedication and psychosocial services. An\\nimportant development in MAT during the\\n1990s was the 1997 publication of recommen-\\ndations by a National Institutes of Health con-\\nsensus panel on effective medical treatment of\\nopiate addiction. After hearing from experts\\nand the public and examining the literature,\\nthe panel concluded that ì[opioid addiction] is\\na medical disorder that can be effectively treat-\\ned with significant benefits for the patient and\\nsocietyî (National Institutes of Health 1997b,\\np. 18). That panel explicitly rejected the notion\\nìthat [addiction] is self-induced or a failure of\\nwillpower and that efforts to treat it inevitably\\nfailî (p. 18). It called for ìa commitment to\\noffer effective treatment for [opioid addiction]\\nto all who need itî (p. 2). The panel also called\\nfor Federal and State efforts to reduce the \\nstigma attached to MAT and to expand MAT\\nthrough increased funding, less restrictive'),\n",

It prevents new\\nprograms from opening when community oppo-\\nsition develops. It can affect a programís inter-\\nnal operations. Staff members who work in\\nOTPs sometimes absorb societyís antipathy\\ntoward patients in MAT and may deliver pro-\\ngram services with a punitive or counterthera-\\npeutic demeanor. OTPs must guard against\\nthese attitudes through supervision, education,\\nand leadership efforts (see chapter 14).\\nSeveral factors have made the destructive force\\nof stigma particularly intractable, including the\\nisolation of MAT from mainstream medicine,\\nnegative media reports about treatment, and\\nthe public impressions made by poorly run\\nprograms. Fortunately, positive changes are\\noccurring in each area.\\nPositive stories about MAT in the media are\\nsometimes overshadowed by highly charged\\nnegative accounts, for example, stories about\\npatients loitering outside OTPs or diversion of\\ntake-home doses. SAMHSA, recognizing that\\nì[s]ignificant reduction in stigma and changes\\nin attitudes will require a concerted effort\\nbased on systematic researchî (CSAT 2000b, \\np. 4), has undertaken\\na national educational\\ncampaign, titled\\nPartners for\\nRecovery. Many OTP\\nmanagers and staff\\nmembers have isolat-\\ned themselves from\\ntheir communities,\\nwhich contributes to\\nnegative stereotypes\\nand media stories.\\nManagers and staff\\nmembers should\\ndevelop effective skills\\nfor working with the\\nmedia. The consensus\\npanel believes that the\\npatient advocacy\\nmovement also can advance a national educa-\\ntional campaign about MAT.\\nStrong efforts are needed to eliminate stigma\\nwithin OTPs as well. Staff members should\\ntreat patients with respect and pay attention \\nto the terms they use. The term ìsubstitution\\ntreatmentî should be avoided because it incor-\\nrectly implies that long-acting opioid medica-\\ntions act like heroin and other short-acting \\nopioids. Terms such as ìdirtyî and ìcleanî in\\nreference to drug-test specimens should be\\nreplaced by more clinically useful terms such\\nas ìpositiveî and ìnegative,î respectively. The\\nuse of criminal justice terms such as ìproba-\\ntionary treatmentî should be replaced with\\nclinically appropriate language (see chapter 14).\\nFinally, programs should become better neigh-\\nbors.

Although a smaller\\npattern of nonmedical opioid use continued as\\nwell, mainly opium smoking among Chinese\\nimmigrants and members of the Caucasian\\nìundergroundî (e.g., prostitutes, gamblers,\\npetty criminals), iatrogenic addiction was much\\nmore common (White 1998). By the late 19th\\ncentury, probably two-thirds of those addicted\\nto opioids (including opium, morphine, and\\nlaudanum) were middle- and upper-class White\\nwomen, a fact Brecher and the Editors of\\nConsumer Reports (1972, p. 17) attribute to\\nìthe widespread medical custom of prescribing\\nopiates for menstrual and menopausal discom-\\nfort, and the many proprietary opiates pre-\\nscribed for ëfemale troubles.í î Civil War veter-\\nans who were addicted by medical procedures\\ncomposed another group, but their numbers\\nwere dwindling. By 1900, an estimated 300,000\\npersons were opioid addicted in the United\\nStates (Brecher and Editors 1972; Courtwright\\n2001; Courtwright et al. 1989).\\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries,\\nU.S. society generally viewed iatrogenic addic-\\ntion among women and disabled war veterans\\nsympatheticallyóas an unfortunate medical\\nconditionóand treated these groups with \\ntolerance and empathy, particularly because\\nneither group presented major social problems\\n(Courtwright 2001). Doctors usually prescribed\\nmore opioids for these patients, and sanatori-\\nums were established for questionable ìcuresî\\nof the resulting addictions. The chronic nature\\nof opioid addiction soon became evident, how-\\never, because many people who entered sanato-\\nriums for a cure relapsed to addictive opioid\\nuse after discharge. In Eugene OíNeillís autobi-\\nographical drama ìLong Dayís Journey Into\\nNight,î for example, his father refuses to\\nreturn OíNeillís mother, who is addicted, to a\\nsanatorium because he is aware of the addictive\\nqualities of morphine and is resigned to the\\ninevitability of relapse (Courtwright 2001).\\nBy the end of the 19th century, doctors became\\nmore cautious in prescribing morphine and\\nother opioids, and the prevalence of opioid\\naddiction decreased. Small groups still prac-\\nticed opium smoking, but most Americans\\nregarded it as socially irresponsible and\\nimmoral. It is noteworthy, however, that \\nheroin, introduced in 1898 as a cough suppres-\\nsant, also began to be misused for its euphoric\\nqualities, gradually attracting new types of\\nusers. This development, along with diffusion\\nof the hypodermic technique of drug adminis-\\ntration, which gained popularity between 1910\\nand 1920, had a profound effect on opioid use\\nand addiction in the 20th century and beyond\\n(Courtwright 2001).\\n12 Chapter 2\\n[O]pioids were \\nprescribed widely\\nto alleviate acute\\nand chronic pain,\\nother types of dis-\\ncomfort, and\\nstress.'),\n",

The Harrison\\nNarcotic Act of 1914 was the earliest significant\\nFederal attempt to place strict controls on opi-\\noids and other substances (Brecher and Editors\\n1972). Although U.S. mercantile and trade\\ninterests were also at stake, the widely held\\nperception that people with addictions generally\\nwere members of a White criminal underclass\\nor a Chinese minority has been portrayed as \\nan underlying motivation for the statute\\n(Courtwright 2001; Courtwright et al. 1989).\\nThe Harrison Act was conceived not as a prohi-\\nbition law but as a measure to regulate the\\nmanufacture, distribution, and prescription of\\nopioids, coca, and their derivatives. Under the\\nactís provisions, manufacturers, pharmacists,\\nand physicians had to be licensed, keep records\\nfor inspection, and pay modest fees to the U.S.\\nDepartment of the Treasury, referred to here-\\nafter as Treasury. \\nThe act permitted physicians and dentists to\\ndispense or distribute opioids ìto a patient . . .\\nin the course of [the physicianís] professional\\npractice onlyî (38 Stat. 786 [1914]). Although\\nthis provision permitted physicians to prescribe\\nor dispense opioids so long as they kept the\\nrequired records, Treasury interpreted the act\\nas a prohibition on physiciansí prescribing opi-\\noids to persons with addictions to maintain\\ntheir addictions. (Treasury was the agency\\nresponsible for enforcing the Harrison Act as\\nwell as prohibition laws.) Treasuryís position\\nappeared to be that addiction is not a disease\\nand the person with an addiction, therefore,\\nwas not a patient. It followed that any physi-\\ncian prescribing or dispensing opioids to such\\nindividuals was not doing so in the ìcourse of\\nhis professional practiceî (White 1998). In\\n1919, the United States Supreme Court upheld\\nTreasuryís interpretation. This interpretation\\nand enforcement of the Harrison Act effectively\\nended, until well into the 1960s, any legitimate\\nrole for the general medical profession in \\nmedication-assisted treatment for Americans\\nwho had drug addictions (White 1998).\\nEarly treatment efforts\\nUntil the 1919 Supreme Court decision uphold-\\ning Treasuryís interpretation of the Harrison\\nAct, numerous municipalities with large num-\\nbers of residents who were opioid addicted\\nwere operating treatment clinics in which \\nmorphine was prescribed or dispensed. Some\\nclinics prescribed heroin and cocaine\\n(Courtwright et al. 1989). These early OTPs\\nvaried in how they functioned; some provided\\ndetoxification treatment and others adopted a\\nmaintenance policy (Courtwright 2001; Gewirtz\\n1969).

The prescribed stay\\nwas about 6 months, although some patients\\nstayed longer. Prisoners could stay for up to 10\\nyears. These hospitals offered social, medical,\\npsychological, and psychiatric services in \\naddition to detoxification and had a low\\npatient-to-staff ratio (about 2 to 1), but the\\natmosphere was described as prisonlike, espe-\\ncially at the Lexington facility (White 1998).\\nTwo major followup studies showed the pro-\\ngram to be a failure.

The second found a relapse rate\\nof 97 percent in 453 former patients over fol-\\nlowup periods of 6 months to 5 years (Duvall et\\nal. 1963). The Lexington hospital facility was\\nturned over to the Bureau of Prisons in 1974\\n(Courtwright et al. 1989).

A followup study in\\n1956 showed a high posttreatment relapse rate\\n(e.g., at least 86 percent of patients admitted in\\n1955), and the Riverside facility was closed in\\n1961 (Brecher and Editors 1972).\\nExperiment in civil \\ncommitment\\nCivil commitment is portrayed by Brecher and\\nthe Editors of Consumer Reports (1972) and\\nWhite (1998) as legislation enabling those with\\nsubstance addiction and those ìin imminent\\ndanger of becoming addictedî (White 1998, p.\\n250) to be confined in rehabilitation centers\\nwithout having first committed or been convict-\\ned of a crime.

Dole, a specialist in\\nmetabolism at The Rockefeller University,\\nbecame chair of the Narcotics Committee of the\\nHealth Research Council of New York City.\\nAfter studying the scientific, public health, and\\nsocial ramifications of addiction in the city, he\\nreceived a grant to establish a research unit to\\ninvestigate the feasibility of opioid mainte-\\nnance. In preparing for this research, he read\\nThe Drug Addict as a Patient by Dr. Marie E.\\nNyswander (Nyswander 1956), a psychiatrist\\nwith extensive experience treating patients who\\nwere addicted to opioids. She was convinced\\nthat these individuals could be treated within\\ngeneral medical practice. She also believed that\\nmany would have to be maintained on opioids\\nfor extended periods to function because a \\nsignificant number of people who attempted\\nabstinence without medication relapsed, in\\nspite of detoxifications, hospitalizations, and\\npsychotherapy (Brecher and Editors 1972;\\nCourtwright et al. 1989). Dr. Nyswander joined\\nDr. Doleís research staff in 1964. Among others\\njoining the team was clinical investigator Dr.\\nMary Jeanne Kreek.\\nThese researchers realized that morphine,\\nwhich is related to heroin, was not a good\\nchoice as an opioid maintenance drug because\\npatientsí social functioning was impaired by\\nmorphineís sedating effects (White 1998). Also,\\nthe short half-life of morphine required several\\ninjections per day, and, as tolerance developed,\\nincreasing amounts were needed over a short\\ntime for patients to remain stable (Brecher and\\nEditors 1972). Other short-acting opioids, such\\nas heroin, codeine, oxycodone, and meperidine\\n(Demerol\\nÆ), showed similar results (Dole 1980,\\n1988).\\nDevelopment of methadone\\nWith short-acting opioids eliminated as options\\nfor maintenance therapy, research focused on\\nmethadone. Methadone appeared to be longer\\nacting and effective when administered orally.\\nIt also was selected on the basis of observations\\nof its use in patients withdrawing from heroin\\nand as an analgesic in the experimental treat-\\nment of pain (Dole 1980, 1988). In 1964, tech-\\nnology was not available to measure blood levels\\nof heroin, morphine, or methadone to assess\\nduration of action. Proof of the efficacy of\\nmethadone maintenance treatment depended\\non observation and recognition by researchers.\\nIn an initial study, methadone was adminis-\\ntered to two patients previously maintained on\\nmorphine. Once tolerance for daily doses of 50\\nto 120 mg was established, patients could func-\\ntion normally without the anxiety associated\\nwith drug craving (White 1998). During this\\nresearch, the following important findings\\nabout methadone maintenance were noted, all\\nsupporting its efficacy and benefits (Dole 1980,\\n1988):\\nï Patients did not experience euphoric, tran-\\nquilizing, or analgesic effects. Their affect\\nand consciousness were normal. Therefore,\\nthey could socialize and work normally with-\\nout the incapacitating effects of short-acting\\nopioids such as morphine or heroin.\\nï A therapeutic, appropriate dose of methadone\\nreduced or blocked the euphoric and tran-\\nquilizing effects of all opioid drugs examined\\n(e.g., morphine, heroin, meperidine, and\\nopium), regardless of whether a patient\\ninjected or smoked the drugs.\\nï No change usually occurred in tolerance \\nlevels for methadone over time, unlike for\\nmorphine and other opioids; therefore, a\\ndose could be held constant for extended\\nperiods (more than 20 years in some cases). \\n17History of Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction'),\n",

Because Dole\\nand his colleagues knew that an independent\\nevaluation of this new treatment would be \\nnecessary, a team headed by Dr. Frances Rowe\\nGearing was formed at Columbia University\\nSchool of Public Health to evaluate patient\\nprogress as this treatment expanded. In general,\\nthe team found that patientsí social functioning\\nimproved with time in treatment, as measured\\nby elimination of illicit-opioid use and better\\noutcomes in employment, school attendance,\\nand homemaking. Most patients were stabilized\\non methadone doses of 80 to 120 mg/day. Most\\npatients who remained in treatment subse-\\nquently eliminated illicit-opioid use. However,\\n20 percent or more of these patients also had\\nentered treatment with alcohol and polysub-\\nstance abuse problems, despite intake screening\\nthat attempted to eliminate these patients from\\ntreatment (Gearing and Schweitzer 1974).\\nMethadone treatment was continued for these\\npatients, along with attempts to treat their \\nalcoholism and polysubstance abuse. Further\\nevaluation, research, and expansion of the \\nprogram ultimately were recommended (Joseph\\nand Dole 1970) and instituted. Methadone\\nmaintenance became a major public health \\ninitiative to treat opioid addiction under the\\nleadership of Dr. Jerome Jaffe, who headed the\\nSpecial Action Office for Drug Abuse\\nPrevention in the Executive Office of the White\\nHouse in the early 1970s. Dr. Jaffeís office\\noversaw the creation of a nationwide, publicly\\nfunded system of treatment programs for \\nopioid addiction.\\nDevelopment of LAAM\\nLike methadone, levo-alpha acetyl methadol\\n(LAAM) was classified as a U.S. Drug\\nEnforcement Administration (DEA) schedule II\\ncontrolled substance (i.e., having a high poten-\\ntial for abuse but also a currently accepted\\nmedical use) that creates a pharmacologic\\ncross-tolerance for other opioids and therefore\\nblocks their euphoric effects while controlling\\nopioid craving. Whereas methadone suppressed\\nopioid withdrawal symptoms for 24 hours or\\nlonger, LAAM achieved this effect for 48 to 72\\nhours or longer.\\nLAAM was first developed in 1948 by German\\nchemists as an analgesic (Finn and Wilcock\\n1997). By the late 1960s, interest arose in\\nLAAM as an alternative to methadone\\n(American Association for the Treatment of\\nOpioid Dependence n.d.). Between 1969 and\\n1981, 27 separate studies of more than 6,000\\npatients established LAAMís safety and efficacy\\n(National Institute on Drug Abuse 1993a). The\\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\\napproved LAAM for use in OTPs in July 1993\\n(National Institute on Drug Abuse 1993a).\\nLater studies continued to confirm that LAAM\\nwas an effective alternative to methadone and\\nwas preferred by some patients (Glanz et al.\\n1997). However, in April 2001, based on\\nreported LAAM-related disturbances in cardiac\\nfunction, FDA and Roxane Laboratories, Inc.,\\nmanufacturer of ORLAAM\\nÆ, strengthened the\\nwarnings in LAAM product labeling (Haehl\\n2001).

Coverage of buprenorphine is\\nshort because TIP 40, Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Buprenorphine\\nin the Treatment of Opioid Addiction(CSAT 2004a), discusses its phar-\\nmacology in more detail. Coverage of naltrexone is short because its use\\nin the United States generally has been limited to easing withdrawal\\nsymptoms for a small portion of patients undergoing medically super-\\nvised withdrawal after maintenance treatment. Exhibit 3-1 provides\\ninformation about these and other medications for opioid addiction\\ntreatment, including the year of their U.S. Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) approval and their U.S. Drug Enforcement\\nAdministration (DEA) drug schedule assignment.\\nThe most frequently used medication for opioid addiction treatment in\\nOTPs is methadone, and much of this chapter focuses on methadone\\npharmacology. LAAM always has been used much less than methadone,\\nand its use was reduced further in 2001, after it was associated with car-\\ndiac arrhythmia in some patients.

Opioid agonists bind to the mu opiate\\nreceptors on the surfaces of brain cells, which\\nmediate the analgesic and other effects of opi-\\noids. Methadone and LAAM produce a range\\nof mu agonist effects similar to those of short-\\nacting opioids. Therapeutically appropriate\\ndoses of these agonist medications produce\\ncross-tolerance for short-acting opioids such as\\nmorphine and heroin, thereby suppressing\\nwithdrawal symptoms and opioid craving as a\\nshort-acting opioid is eliminated from the body.\\nThe dose needed to produce cross-tolerance\\ndepends on a patientís level of tolerance for\\nshort-acting opioids.\\nLAAM is longer acting than methadone. Unlike\\nmethadone, it cannot be administered daily\\nbecause its longer duration of action would\\nlead to accumulation of toxic levels in the \\nbody that could result in death (Roxane\\nLaboratories, Inc., 2001). Articles by Oda \\nand Kharasch (2001) and Walsh and colleagues\\n(1998), as well as the manufacturerís package\\ninsert for ORLAAM\\nÆ(Roxane Laboratories,\\nInc., 2001), provide more information on\\nLAAMís pharmacology.\\nWhen given intramuscularly or orally,\\nmethadone suppresses pain for 4 to 6 hours.\\nIntramuscular methadone is used only for\\npatients who cannot take oral methadone, \\nfor example, patients in medication-assisted\\ntreatment for opioid addiction (MAT) who are\\nadmitted to a hospital for emergency medical\\nprocedures. Methadone should not be given\\nparenterally in an OTP .\\nBecause of its extensive bioavailability and\\nlonger half-life, an adequate daily oral dose of\\nmethadone suppresses withdrawal and drug\\ncraving for 24 to 36 hours in most patients who\\nare opioid addicted. Patients with special needs\\nmay require split methadone doses given more\\nthan once daily. Methadone is metabolized\\nchiefly by the cytochrome P3A4 (CYP3A4)\\nenzyme system (Oda and Kharasch 2001),\\nwhich is significant when methadone is co-\\nadministered with other medications that also\\noperate along this metabolic pathway (see\\nìInteractions With Other Therapeutic\\nMedicationsî below).\\nAfter patient induction into methadone \\npharmacotherapy, a steady-state concentration\\n(i.e., the level at which the amount of drug\\nentering the body equals the amount being\\nexcreted) of methadone usually is achieved in 5\\nto 7.5 days (four to five half-lives of the drug).\\nMethadoneís pharmacological profile supports\\nsustained activity at the mu opiate receptors,\\nwhich allows substantial normalization of many\\nphysiological disturbances resulting from the\\nrepeated cycles of intoxication and withdrawal\\nassociated with addiction to short-acting \\nopioids. Therapeutically appropriate doses \\nof methadone also attenuate or block the\\neuphoric effects of heroin and other opioids.\\nGoodman and Gilmanís Pharmacological \\nBasis of Therapeutics (Hardman et al. 2001)\\nprovides a comprehensive description of\\nmethadoneís pharmacological effects.\\nMethadone is up to 80 percent orally bio-\\navailable, and its elimination half-life ranges\\nfrom 24 to 36 hours. When methadone is\\nadministered daily in steady oral doses, its\\nlevel in blood should maintain a 24-hour\\nasymptomatic state, without episodes of over-\\nmedication or withdrawal (Payte and Zweben\\n1998). Methadoneís body clearance rate varies\\nconsiderably between individuals. The serum\\nmethadone level (SML) and elimination half-\\nlife are influenced by several factors including\\npregnancy and a patientís absorption,\\nmetabolism and protein binding, changes in\\nurinary pH, use of other medications, diet,\\nphysical condition, age, and use of vitamin and\\nherbal products (Payte and Zweben 1998).\\nMeasuring methadone via SMLs helps \\ndetermine how much is circulating in patientsí'),\n",

In a typical 24-hour period after \\ndosing, SMLs should peak after about 2 to 4\\nhours and decline gradually to trough levels\\nthereafter (Payte and Zweben 1998). Although\\nresearchers have noted a strong correlation\\nbetween methadone dosage and serum concen-\\ntrations in some patients, the relationship is \\nnot necessarily linear, and a high degree of\\nvariation exists among patients (reviewed by\\nLeavitt et al. 2000). The rate-of-change ratio\\nbetween peak and trough SMLs can be useful\\nclinically; Payte and Zweben (1998) suggested\\nthat peak SMLs should not exceed twice the\\ntrough levels.\\nResearchers have found that trough SMLs of\\n150 to 600 ng/mL are necessary to suppress\\ndrug craving (reviewed in Leavitt et al. 2000).\\nMany treatment providers consider that trough\\nSMLs of $400 ng/mL provide adequate opioid\\ncross-tolerance, thereby controlling patientsí\\nopioid abuse; however, Eap and colleagues\\n(2002) found no studies that validated these\\nminimum trough levels.\\nMethadone has two enantiomeric forms, ì(R)-î\\n(also called levo- or \\nL-) methadone and ì(S)-î\\n(dextro- or D-) methadone, which have the\\nsame chemical formula but different spatial\\narrangements. OTPs in the United States use a\\n50:50 racemic mixture of these two enantiomers.\\nOnly (R)-methadone has clinically significant\\nmu receptor agonist activity, and its potency as\\nan analgesic is 50 times greater than that of (S)-\\nmethadone (Eap et al. 2002). (R)-methadone\\nalso has a significantly higher mean clearance\\nrate than (S)-methadone (Eap et al. 1999).\\nMethadone is metabolized into inactive metabo-\\nlites, mainly in the liver by CYP450 enzymes,\\nbut probably also by enzymes in the intestines.\\nThese metabolites are then excreted. Drugs\\nthat induce or inhibit this enzyme activity can\\naffect methadone metabolism. If these enzymes\\nare stimulated by other medications, the dura-\\ntion of methadoneís effect and SMLs may be\\nlowered, precipitating withdrawal symptoms. If\\nthese enzymes are inhibited by other medica-\\ntions, methadone metabolism may be slowed,\\nand the SMLs and duration of methadoneís\\neffect in patients may be increased (Eap et al.\\n2002; Leavitt et al. 2000; Payte and Zweben\\n1998).\\nSeveral CYP450 isoforms help metabolize\\nmethadone, including CYP3A4 (the most abun-\\ndant), CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and possibly, but to\\na smaller extent, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and\\nCYP2C19 (Cozza and Armstrong 2001; Eap et\\nal. 2002; Gerber et al. 2004). Different\\nenzymes metabolize (R)- and (S)-methadone\\ndifferently. Numerous genetic and environmen-\\ntal factors affect these\\nenzymes and account\\nfor variations in\\nmethadone\\nmetabolism among\\nindividuals. Some\\nenzymes also play a\\npart in metabolizing\\nother medications,\\nsuch as benzodi-\\nazepines, antidepres-\\nsants, anticonvul-\\nsants, antibiotics, and\\nantiviral agents (e.g.,\\nHIV protease\\ninhibitors). Through\\ntheir effects on these\\nenzymes, some medi-\\ncations can raise or\\nlower patientsí SMLs. Especially during initia-\\ntion of methadone maintenance, methadone\\ncan increase CYP3A4 activity, thereby acceler-\\nating its own metabolism in some individuals\\n(Eap et al. 2002; Leavitt et al. 2000).\\nCYP2D6 selectively metabolizes the (R)-\\nmethadone enantiomer. Production of this\\nenzyme is affected by genetic factors. A small\\nportion of the population does not produce\\nmuch CYP2D6, whereas others have very high\\nCYP2D6 activity. The latter group may require\\nmuch higher methadone doses to compensate\\nfor their high rate of (R)-methadone\\nmetabolism (Eap et al. 2002; Leavitt et al.\\n2000). Individuals also differ considerably in\\nCYP3A4 and CYP1A2 activity, accounting in\\npart for the wide variations in methadone\\nmetabolism (Eap et al. 2002).\\n29Pharmacology of Medications Used To Treat Opioid Addiction\\n[A]n adequate\\ndaily oral dose \\nof methadone \\nsuppresses with-\\ndrawal and drug\\ncraving for 24 to\\n36 hours...'),\n",

Research has demonstrated\\nthat buprenorphineís partial agonist effects at\\nmu receptors, its unusually high affinity for\\nthese receptors, and its slow dissociation from\\nthem are principal determinants of its pharma-\\ncological profile (Cowan 2003).\\nIn the 1990s, researchers determined that, as a\\npartial mu agonist, buprenorphine does not\\nactivate mu receptors fully (i.e., it has low\\nintrinsic activity), resulting in a ceiling effect\\nthat prevents larger doses of buprenorphine\\nfrom producing greater agonist effects (Walsh\\net al. 1994). As a result, there is a greater mar-\\ngin of safety from death by respiratory depres-\\nsion when increased doses of buprenorphine\\nare used, compared with increased doses of full\\nopioid agonists. Buprenorphine overdose is\\nuncommon, although it has been reported in\\nFrance, and it is associated almost always with\\ninjection of buprenorphine coupled with inges-\\ntion of high doses of benzodiazepines, alcohol,\\nor other sedative-type substances (Kintz 2001,\\n2002). Another feature of  buprenorphine is\\nthat it can be used on a daily or less-than-daily\\nbasis. Typically, the interdosing interval is\\nextended by doubling or tripling the daily dose\\nto permit alternate-day or thrice weekly dosing\\n(Amass et al. 2000, 2001), which is possible\\nbecause, although larger doses do not increase\\nbuprenorphineís agonist activity, they do length-\\nen its duration of action (Chawarski et al. 1999).\\nBuprenorphine also may be an excellent agent\\nto facilitate detoxification from illicit opioids\\nand abused prescription opioids. Although it\\nhas a relatively short plasma half-life (about 4\\nto 6 hours), buprenorphine has a long duration\\nof action resulting from its high affinity for and\\ncorrespondingly slow dissociation from the mu\\nreceptor (Cowan 2003). This slow dissociation\\nlikely reduces the magnitude of withdrawal\\nsymptoms during detoxification (Johnson et al.\\n2003b). Some evidence supports a short-term\\ncourse of buprenorphine-naloxone therapy for\\ndetoxification from opioids.\\nBuprenorphine is metabolized in the liver by\\nthe CYP3A4 subgroup of CYP450 enzymes\\n(Kobayashi et al. 1998), and, like methadone\\nand LAAM, its rate of metabolism is affected\\nby coadministration of other medications\\nmetabolized along this pathway.\\nDepending on the dosage, buprenorphine activ-\\nity can be viewed as falling between that of full\\nagonists, such as methadone and LAAM, and\\nantagonists, such as naltrexone (Exhibit 3-3)\\n(Johnson et al. 2003b). Because it is a partial\\nagonist at higher doses, buprenorphine also\\ncan precipitate opioidlike withdrawal symp-\\ntoms in patients with high levels of physical\\ndependence on opioids, making it appear to\\nfunction more like an antagonist under these\\nconditions (see ìInductionî in chapter 5).\\nNaltrexone\\nNaltrexone is a highly effective opioid antago-\\nnist that tightly binds to mu opiate receptors.\\nBecause it has a higher affinity for these recep-\\ntors than has heroin, morphine, or methadone,\\nnaltrexone displaces those drugs from receptors\\nand blocks their effects. It can, therefore, \\nprecipitate withdrawal in patients who have not\\nbeen abstinent from short-acting opioids for at\\nleast 7 days and have not been abstinent from\\nlong-acting ones, such as methadone, for at\\nleast 10 days (OíConnor and Fiellin 2000).\\nNaltrexone displaces buprenorphine to a lesser\\ndegree, but, in high enough doses, it overrides\\nbuprenorphineís activity as well.\\nBecause naltrexone has no narcotic effect,\\nthere are no withdrawal symptoms when a\\npatient stops using naltrexone, nor does nal-\\ntrexone have abuse potential. Early research\\nconcluded that tolerance does not develop for\\nnaltrexoneís antagonist properties, even after\\nmany months of regular use (Kleber et al.\\n1985). A 50 mg tablet markedly attenuates or\\nblocks opioid effects for 24 hours, and a 100 to\\n150 mg dose can block opioid effects for up to\\n72 hours (OíBrien et al. 1975).\\n30 Chapter 3'),\n",

A QT interval is\\nthat part of a patientís electrocardiogram read-\\ning that begins at the onset of the QRS complex\\nand extends to the end of the T wave. The QT\\ninterval represents the time between the start\\nof ventricular depolarization and the end of\\nventricular repolarization. The QT interval\\nnormally varies depending on heart rate, age,\\nand gender. The QT interval may be influenced\\nby electrolyte balance, medications, and\\nischemia. A prolonged QT interval increases\\nthe risk of developing a cardiac arrhythmia\\ncalled torsade de pointes. \\nCases of torsade de pointes have been reported\\nin patients taking high doses of methadone\\n(mean daily doses of approximately 400 mg).\\nAlthough information about this effect is limit-\\ned, 6 of 17 patients who developed torsade de\\npointes in one study had an increase in their\\nmethadone dose during the month preceding\\narrhythmia (Krantz et al. 2003). This finding\\nsupported the possibility that methadone con-\\ntributed to the development of arrhythmia.\\nFurthermore, Martell and colleagues (2003)\\nshowed that, regardless of dose, a statistically\\nsignificant increase occurred in QT intervals\\nduring the first 2 months of treatment.\\nPractitioners should be aware of potential QT-\\nprolonging effects of methadone, especially at\\nhigh doses, and should be aware of interactions\\nwith other medications that also have QT-\\nprolonging properties or with medications that\\nslow the elimination of methadone.  \\nLAAM\\nLAAM has been associated with prolonged QT\\ninterval in some patients and, in rare cases,\\nwith death from torsade de pointes arrhythmia.\\nAs a result, it has been taken off the market in\\nEurope, and it has been given a ìblack boxî\\nwarning (i.e., a required warning on the pack-\\nage insert and other product-related materials)\\nin the United States by FDA. These findings\\nhave led to discontinuation of LAAM therapy\\nfor new patients by most American OTPs.\\nCurrently, it is labeled for use only when no\\nother treatment option exists or for continuing\\nuse in patients who already have demonstrated\\ntolerability for the medication (Roxane\\nLaboratories, Inc., 2001).\\nBefore a patient is started on LAAM, providers\\nmust follow informed-consent procedures\\nabout QT interval prolongation and provide\\ninformation about the possibility of arrhythmia\\nand sudden death (CSAT 1999b). Patients\\nshould be screened for cardiac risk factors,\\nincluding preexisting prolonged QT intervals or\\nother cardiac problems (Food and Drug\\nAdministration 2001; Schwetz 2001). More\\ninformation about LAAM is available from\\nRoxane Laboratories Technical Product\\nInformation at 800-962-8364 and in chapter 2.\\nSide Effects of Naltrexone\\nApproximately 10 percent of patients receiving\\nnaltrexone have gastrointestinal side effects\\n(e.g., nausea and vomiting) that may necessi-\\ntate stopping the medication.

Increases\\nin liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase\\nand alanine aminotransferase) were observed\\nin individuals receiving buprenorphine who\\nalso were positive for hepatitis C (Petry et \\nal. 2000). At this writing, 53 cases of \\nbuprenorphine-associated hepatitis have been\\nreported in France since 1996 (Auriacombe et\\nal. 2003). One report suggested an association\\nbetween injection buprenorphine misuse and\\nliver toxicity, possibly from buprenorphineís\\nincreased bioavailability when administered\\nparenterally (Berson et al. 2001). The direct\\nrole of buprenorphine in these abnormalities \\nis unclear because many individuals in these\\nstudies might have had hepatitis B or C.\\nAdditional studies are needed to clarify this issue.\\nInteractions With\\nOther Therapeutic\\nMedications \\nBecause methadone, LAAM, and buprenor-\\nphine are metabolized chiefly by the CYP3A4\\nenzyme system (a part of the CYP450 system),\\ndrugs that inhibit or induce the CYP450 system\\ncan alter the pharmacokinetic properties of\\nthese medications.

OTPs should develop policies and\\nprocedures for homicide and other violent \\nsituations. The OTPís policy on violence and\\nthreats of violence should be explained at the\\nbeginning of treatment. Emergency screening\\nand assessment procedures should include \\nthe following:\\nï Asking the patient questions specific to \\nhomicidal ideation, including thoughts, \\nplans, gestures, or attempts in the past year;\\nweapons charges; and previous arrests,\\nrestraining orders, or other legal procedures\\nrelated to real or potential violence at home\\nor the workplace.\\nï Documenting violent incidents and diligent\\nmonitoring of these records to assess the\\nnature and magnitude of workplace violence\\nand to quantify risk. When a threat appears\\nimminent, all legal, human resource, employ-\\nee assistance, community mental health, and\\nlaw enforcement resources should be readied\\nto respond immediately (National Institute\\nfor Occupational Safety and Health 1996).\\nAdmission Procedures\\nand Initial Evaluation\\nAfter initial applicant screening, the admission\\nprocess should be thorough and facilitate timely\\nenrollment in the OTP . This process usually\\nmarks patientsí first substantial exposure to the\\ntreatment system, including its personnel, other\\npatients, available services, rules, and require-\\nments. The admission process should be\\ndesigned to engage new patients positively while\\nscreening for and assessing problems and needs\\nthat might affect MAT interventions. \\nTimely Admission, Waiting\\nLists, and Referrals\\nThe longer the delays between first contact, \\ninitial screening, and admission and the more\\nappointments required to complete these proce-\\ndures, the fewer the applicants who actually\\nenter treatment. Prompt, efficient orientation\\nand evaluation contribute to the therapeutic\\nnature of the admission process.\\nIf a program is at capacity, admitting staff\\nshould advise applicants immediately of a \\nwaiting list and provide one or more referrals\\nto programs that can meet their treatment\\nneeds more quickly. A centralized intake pro-\\ncess across programs can facilitate the admis-\\nsion process, particularly when applicants must\\nbe referred. For example, if an applicant\\naccepts referral to another provider, telephone\\ncontact by the originating program often can\\nfacilitate the applicantís acceptance into the\\nreferral program. If an applicant goes willingly\\nto another program for immediate treatment\\nbut prefers admission to the original OTP , the\\nadmission process should be completed and the\\napplicantís name added to the waiting list.\\nPatients who prefer to await treatment at the\\noriginal site should be added to the waiting list\\nand contacted periodically to determine\\nwhether they want to continue waiting or be\\nreferred. For individuals who are ineligible,\\nstaff should assess the need for other acute ser-\\nvices and promptly make appropriate referrals.\\nThe consensus panel recommends that each\\nOTP establish criteria to decide which prequal-\\nified patients should receive admission priority,\\nespecially when a program is near capacity.

Physical\\ndependence on opioids can be demonstrated by\\nless drastic measures. For example, a patient\\ncan be observed for the effects of withdrawal\\nafter he or she has not used a short-acting \\nopioid for 6 to 8 hours.

SAMHSA regulations stipulate ìat\\nleast eight random drug abuse testsî annually\\nper patient, performed according to accepted\\nOTP practice (CFR 42, Part 8 ß 12(f)(6)).\\nGiven that some drugs are metabolized exten-\\nsively and excreted quickly, it is important that\\nanalytic procedures provide the highest sensi-\\ntivity for substances of interest, such as breath\\ntesting for alcohol use.\\nTB testing\\nThe risk of TB infection and disease is high\\namong individuals involved with drugs (Batki\\net al. 2002). Rates of active TB among people\\nwho use substances and are HIV infected are\\nhigh (Gourevitch et al. 1999), and cases of \\nmultidrug-resistant TB in this group are\\nincreasing. All patients should undergo screen-\\ning and medical examination for TB every 12\\nmonths. Anergy panel tests should be adminis-\\ntered to anergic patients (those with diminished\\nreactivity to certain antigens). Patients who are\\nimmune system compromised might have a \\nnegative purified protein derivative test, even\\nwith active infection. A chest x ray or sputum\\nanalysis should be done if there is doubt. If a\\npatient has a positive TB test, medical staff\\nshould treat the patient accordingly (see chap-\\nter 10) or refer him or her to a primary care\\nclinic for treatment.\\nHepatitis testing\\nPeople who inject drugs are at high risk for\\nhepatitis virus infection (see chapter 10) and\\nshould be tested at\\nadmission to an OTP .\\nHepatitis A is an\\nimportant liver \\ninfection that affects\\npeople who abuse\\ndrugs at higher rates\\nthan people who do\\nnot. Most patients in\\nOTPs are seropositive\\nfor surface antigen or\\nantibody to hepatitis\\nB virus (HBV) core\\nantigen, and some\\nexhibit signs of \\nchronic hepatitis. Any\\npatients whose tests\\nare negative for hep-\\natitis A virus or HBV\\ninfection should be vaccinated for these \\ninfections at the OTP or by referral.\\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) accounts for most new\\nhepatitis cases among people who inject drugs,\\ninfects between 70 and 96 percent of this popu-\\nlation, and is the countryís leading cause of\\nchronic liver disease (Sylvestre 2002b). The\\nconsensus panel strongly recommends that\\nHCV diagnosis and referral be an integral com-\\nponent of initial MAT assessment. Programs\\nthat do not offer onsite HCV antibody testing\\nshould provide appropriate referrals. (A simple\\nblood test for hepatitis C antibodies is avail-\\nable; a positive result does not necessarily \\nsignal current infections, only that antibodies\\nhave developed.)\\n51Initial Screening, Admission Procedures, and Assessment Techniques\\n[R]esults of...the\\nmedical examina-\\ntion are to beÖin\\nthe patientís file\\nwithin 14 days fol-\\nlowing admission.'),\n",

Rapid tests can detect\\nantibodies to HIV in blood obtained by \\nfingerstick or venipuncture, or in oral fluid and\\nprovide reliable and valid results in 20 minutes\\nor less. Thus, the rapid HIV test provides a\\nmeasure of exposure to HIV and requires con-\\nfirmatory testing for a diagnosis of HIV infec-\\ntion.

Clinical examination and an appli-\\ncantís medical history are keys to determine the\\nappropriateness of MAT. Chapter 9 discusses\\ndrug-testing procedures and Federal regulations\\ngoverning these procedures.\\nWomenís Health\\nWomen in MAT should receive information on\\ntheir particular health needs, for example,\\nfamily planning, gynecological health, and\\nmenopause (see the forthcoming TIP Substance\\nAbuse Treatment: Addressing the Specific\\nNeeds of Women[CSAT forthcoming f]).\\nWomen of childbearing age should be counseled\\non pregnancy testing during admission before\\nmaking decisions about detoxification (42 CFR,\\nPart 8 ß 12(e)(3)).

OTP staff members help patients move\\nbeyond past experiences (e.g., negative relation-\\nships with staff, inadequate dosing) by focusing\\non making a fresh start, letting go of old\\ngrievances, and identifying current realities,\\nambivalence about change, and goals for the\\nfuture. It often is helpful to enlist recovering\\npatients in motivational enhancement \\nactivities. TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for\\nChange in Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT\\n1999a), provides extensive information about\\nstages of change, the nature of motivation, \\nand current guidelines for enhancing patient\\nmotivation to change.\\nSubstance Use Assessment\\nAs discussed previously, a patientís lifetime\\nsubstance use and treatment history should be\\ndocumented thoroughly. The following areas\\nshould be assessed:\\nï Periods of abstinence (e.g., number, duration,\\ncircumstances)\\nï Circumstances or events leading to relapse\\nï Effects of substance use on physical, \\npsychological, and emotional functioning\\nï Changing patterns of substance use, with-\\ndrawal signs and symptoms, and medical\\nsequelae.\\nReports of psychiatric symptoms during absti-\\nnence help treatment providers differentiate\\ndrug withdrawal from mental disorder \\nsymptoms and can reveal important clues \\nto effective case management, for example, \\nthe need to refer patients for treatment of \\nco-occurring disorders.\\nChapter 11 discusses treatment methods and\\nconsiderations for patients with histories of\\nmultiple substance abuse. Most of these\\npatients fall into one of three groups, which\\nshould be determined during assessment: those\\nwho use multiple substances (1) to experience\\ntheir psychoactive effects, (2) to self-medicate\\nfor clinically evident reasons (e.g., back pain,\\ninsomnia, headache, co-occurring disorders),\\nor (3) to compensate for inadequate treatment\\nmedication (Leavitt et al. 2000). Multiple sub-\\nstance use should be identified and addressed\\nas soon as possible because of the risk of possi-\\nble overdose for patients who continue to abuse\\ndrugs or alcohol during treatment. Continued\\nsubstance abuse while in MAT might indicate\\nthat another treatment option is more appro-\\npriate. A challenge in treating patients who\\nabuse substances for clinically evident reasons\\nis to determine whether the patients are\\nattempting to medicate undiagnosed, misdiag-\\nnosed, or undertreated problems. If so, then\\neffectively addressing these related problems\\nmay reduce or eliminate continuing drug or\\nalcohol abuse and improve outcomes.\\nCultural Assessment\\nA comprehensive assessment should include\\npatientsí values and assumptions; linguistic\\npreferences; attitudes, practices, and beliefs\\nabout health and well-being; spirituality and\\nreligion; and communication patterns that\\nmight originate partly from cultural traditions\\nand heritage (Office of Minority Health 2001).\\nStaff knowledge about diverse groups is \\nimportant for effective treatment services. Of\\nparticular importance are experiences and \\ncoping mechanisms related to assimilation and\\nacculturation of groups into mainstream\\nAmerican culture that may affect how they \\nperceive substance abuse and MAT.

Until they are\\nstabilized, employed patients often experience\\nsubstance-related difficulties at the workplace,\\nincluding lack of concentration, tardiness and\\nabsences, inability to get along with coworkers,\\non-the-job accidents, and increased claims for\\nworkersí compensation. Early identification of\\nthese difficulties can help staff and patients \\ncreate a more effective treatment plan. \\nPatients who are employed often are reluctant\\nto enter residential treatment or take the time\\nto become stabilized on medication; however,\\nmost of these patients would take medical or\\nother leave time if they were hospitalized for\\nother illnesses, and they should be encouraged\\nto take their addiction as seriously. A physi-\\ncianís note recommending time off work for\\nsome period might help, but it should be on let-\\nterhead that does not reference drug treatment.\\nMilitary or other service \\nhistory\\nA patientís military or other service history can\\nhighlight valuable areas in treatment planning.\\nIn particular, was military service generally a\\npositive or negative experience? If the former,\\ntreatment providers can help patients identify\\nareas of strength or personal achievement,\\nsuch as the ability to cope under stress, receipt\\nof medals for service accomplishments, and\\nhonorable discharge; patients can learn to\\nbuild on past strengths in current challenging\\nsituations and to progress in treatment. If the\\nlatter, providers should review patientsí nega-\\ntive military experiences, including loss of\\nfriends and loved ones, onset of substance use,\\nwar-related injuries, chronic pain, PTSD, and\\nco-occurring disorders (e.g., depression). This\\ninformation might indicate patterns of behavior\\nthat continue to affect recovery.\\nPatientsí military history also might reveal\\ntheir eligibility for medical and treatment\\nresources through U.S. Department of\\nVeterans Affairs programs and hospitals or\\nsocial service agencies.\\nSpirituality\\nìSpiritualityî in this TIP refers to willing\\ninvolvement in socially desirable activities or\\nprocesses that are beyond the immediate details\\nof daily life and personal self-interest. Attention\\nto the ethics of behavior, consideration for the\\ninterests of others, community involvement,\\nhelping others, and participating in organized\\nreligion are expressions of spirituality.\\nA patientís spirituality can be an important\\ntreatment resource, and persons recovering\\nfrom addiction often experience increased\\ninterest in the spiritual aspects of their lives. A\\nstudy by Flynn and colleagues (2003) of 432\\npatients admitted to 18 OTPs found that those\\nwho remained in recovery for 5 years credited\\nreligion or spirituality as one factor in this out-\\ncome. Staff should assess patientsí connections\\nwith religious institutions because these institu-\\ntions often provide a sense of belonging that is\\nvaluable in the rehabilitative process. \\nMiller (1998) found a lack of research explor-\\ning the association between spirituality and\\naddiction recovery but concluded that spiritual\\nengagement or reengagement appeared to be\\ncorrelated with recovery.

Methadone maintenance treatment has\\nthe longest successful track record in patients addicted to opioids for\\nmore than a year and has been shown to control withdrawal symptoms,\\nstabilize physiologic processes, and improve functionality. Studies also\\nhave found that methadone maintenance treatment reduces criminality,\\nnoncompliance with HIV/AIDS therapy, seroconversion to HIV/AIDS,\\nand mortality associated with opioid addiction (Appel et al. 2001; Ball\\nand Ross 1991). Since 2001, LAAM, although effective in opioid pharma-\\ncotherapy, has carried a restrictive label precluding its use as the initial\\nmedication for MAT. As reviewed in chapter 3, the effectiveness of\\nbuprenorphine has been found to be similar to that of methadone and\\nLAAM (Johnson et al. 2000). Sublingual buprenorphine formulations\\nhave been approved for use in OTPs and by physicians in office-based\\nand other health care settings.

Treatment for withdrawal symptoms\\nusually involves administration of a long-acting\\nopioid medication such as methadone or\\nbuprenorphine, which can be followed by grad-\\nual tapering of the medication as withdrawal\\nsymptoms diminish.\\nControl of withdrawal symptoms often is insuf-\\nficient treatment to prevent a relapse to opioid\\nabuse, and detoxification alone may yield only\\nshort-term benefits. Research has shown that\\nretention in treatment over an extended period\\nis key to successful outcomes for opioid addic-\\ntion in many patients, just as it is for other\\nchronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes,\\nand asthma (McLellan et al. 2000). Therefore,\\nwhen detoxification from short-acting opioids is\\nprovided, the consensus panel recommends\\nlinkage to ongoing psychosocial treatment, with\\nor without additional maintenance therapy\\nwith an opioid antagonist such as naltrexone.\\nComprehensive, long-term opioid agonist main-\\ntenance remains the treatment with the best\\ntrack record of controlling opioid use and sav-\\ning lives, although opioid partial agonist thera-\\npy is promising.

Most treat-\\nment providers begin treating new patients\\nwhen there are no signs of opioid intoxication\\nor sedation and some beginning signs of opioid\\nwithdrawal. Administration of the first dose\\nalso should await a physical assessment to rule\\nout any acute, life-threatening condition that\\nopioids might mask or worsen (see chapter 4\\nfor more information on medical assessment).\\nFor naltrexone, patients should be abstinent\\nfrom all short-acting opioids for at least 7 days\\nand from long-acting opioids, such as\\nmethadone, for at least 10 days before begin-\\nning the medication to prevent potentially\\nsevere withdrawal symptoms (OíConnor and\\nFiellin 2000).\\nOther substance use.The presence of sedatives\\nsuch as benzodiazepines or alcohol should be\\nruled out before induction to minimize the \\nlikelihood of oversedation with the first dose.\\nOTP staff should ensure that patients known \\nto abuse sedatives, tranquilizers, tricyclic\\nantidepressants, benzodiazepines, alcohol, or\\nother CNS depressants are told in clear lan-\\nguage of the dangers of adverse effects if they\\ntake these substances while being stabilized or\\nmaintained on methadone, LAAM, or\\nbuprenorphine.\\nObserved dosing. Observed dosing with\\nmethadone, LAAM, or buprenorphine should\\nbe part of the medical safety procedure and\\ndiversion control plan in an OTP and is recom-\\nmended during induction with buprenorphine.\\nObserved dosing is the only way to ensure that\\na patient ingests a\\ngiven dose and to\\nmonitor a patientís\\nresponse. In observed\\ndosing, staff members\\nwho dispense medica-\\ntion first carefully\\nidentify patientsó\\nsometimes by requir-\\ning them to remove\\nhats or dark glasses,\\nfor exampleóand\\nthen provide the \\nmedication.\\nTo ensure that patients swallow oral doses of\\nmethadone or LAAM, they should be required\\nto speak before and after ingesting at least 2\\nounces of liquid in which an appropriate dose\\nof medication is dissolved. For buprenorphine,\\na sublingual tablet should be observed to have\\ndissolved completely under the tongue. After\\nthe first dose, patients should wait in an obser-\\nvation area and be checked 30 to 60 minutes\\nlater for acute adverse effects. If same-day \\ndosing adjustments must be made, patients\\nshould wait 2 to 4 more hours after the addi-\\ntional dosing, for further evaluation when peak\\neffects are achieved. The consensus panel rec-\\nommends that patients be observed for several\\nhours after the first dose of any opioid treat-\\nment medication.

Initial dosing should be followed\\nby dosage increases over subsequent days until\\nwithdrawal symptoms are suppressed at the\\npeak of action for the medication. Methadone,\\nLAAM, and buprenorphine are stored in body\\ntissues, including the liver, from which their\\nslow release keeps blood levels of medication\\nsteady between doses. It is important for physi-\\ncians, staff members, and patients to under-\\nstand that doses of medication are eliminated\\nmore quickly from the bloodstream and medi-\\ncation effects wear off sooner than might be\\nexpected until sufficient levels are attained in\\ntissues. During induction, even without dosage\\nincreases, each successive dose adds to what is\\npresent already in tissues until steady state is\\nreached. Steady state refers to the condition in\\nwhich the level of medication in a patientís\\nblood remains fairly steady because that drugís\\nrate of intake equals the rate of its breakdown\\nand excretion.\\nSteady state is based on multiples of the elimi-\\nnation half-life. Approximately four to five\\nhalf-life times are needed to establish a steady\\nstate for most drugs. For example, because\\nmethadone has a half-life of 24 to 36 hours, its\\nsteady stateóthe time at which a relatively\\nconstant blood level should remain present in\\nthe bodyóis achieved in 5 to 7.5 days after\\ndosage change for most patients.

(Split dosing is discussed further below.)\\nBecause buprenorphineís safety profile makes\\noverdose less of a concern, some providers opt\\nto give even new patients receiving buprenor-\\nphine some take-home medication for multiple\\ndosing during induction (CSAT 2004a).\\nInduction with methadone\\nand LAAM\\nBecause methadone overdose deaths have\\noccurred in the first few days of treatment\\n(Caplehorn and Drummer 1999; Zador and\\nSunjic 2000), it is important to adjust\\nmethadone dosage carefully until stabilization\\nand tolerance are established. Federal regula-\\ntions require that methadone initially be given\\ndaily under observation for either 6 or 7 days\\nper week. (A take-home dose is allowed for all\\npatients when the OTP is closed on Sunday.)\\nLAAM must continue to be given under obser-\\nvation and administered no more than every 2\\nto 3 days.\\nInitial dosing. For a patient actively abusing\\nopioids, a typical first dose of methadone is 20\\nto 30 mg (Joseph et al. 2000) and is limited by\\nregulations to no more than 30 mg. If with-\\ndrawal symptoms persist after 2 to 4 hours, the\\ninitial dose can be supplemented with another 5\\nto 10 mg (Joseph et al. 2000). The total first-\\nday dose of methadone allowed by Federal reg-\\nulations is 40 mg unless a program physician\\ndocuments in the patient record that 40 mg was\\ninsufficient to suppress opioid withdrawal\\nsymptoms (42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(h)(3)(ii)).\\nSince 2001, LAAM has carried a restriction\\nthat precludes its use as an initial medication\\nfor pharmacotherapy because of concerns\\nabout its cardiovascular effects. Although\\ndirect induction with LAAM can be accom-\\nplished with an initial dose of 20 to 40 mg every\\n48 hours, LAAM has been used almost exclu-\\nsively in cases involving transfer of patients\\nfrom methadone maintenance. LAAM must\\nnever be given on 2 consecutive days because\\nits extended duration of action can result in\\ntoxic blood levels leading to fatal overdose.\\nVariations in individual response and optimal\\ndosing.Most differences in patient response to\\nmethadone can be explained by variations in\\nindividual rates of absorption, digestion, and\\nexcretion of the drug, which in turn are caused\\nby such factors as body weight and size, other\\nsubstance use, diet, co-occurring disorders and\\nmedical diseases, and genetic factors. Because\\nvariation in response to methadone is consider-\\nable, the consensus panel believes that the\\nnotion of a uniformly suitable dosage range \\nor an upper dosage limit for all patients is\\nunsupported scientifically.

Bringing patients\\nto this target dosage may be achieved over the\\nfirst 3 days of treatment by doubling the dose\\neach successive day after initial administration.\\nAn initial dose of 4/1 mg (buprenorphine/\\nnaloxone) is recommended, followed in 2 to 4\\nhours with an additional 4/1 mg if indicated.\\nThe dosage should be increased on subsequent\\ndays to the target dosage (ranging from 12/3 to\\n16/4 mg per day). During dose induction,\\npatients may need to visit their OTP or physi-\\ncianís office daily for dose adjustments and\\nclinical monitoring. Further information and\\nguidelines for buprenorphine induction and use\\ncan be found in TIP 40, Clinical Guidelines for\\nthe Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of\\nOpioid Addiction (CSAT 2004a).\\nInduction with naltrexone\\nThe standard procedure for induction to nal-\\ntrexone therapy is first to make certain that\\nthere is an absence of physiological dependence\\non opioids. This often is done by using a\\nNarcan challenge after a 7- to 10-day period\\nduring which opioids are not used. Then the\\npatient is given 25 mg of naltrexone initially,\\nfollowed by 50 mg the next day if no withdrawal\\nsymptoms occur after the first 25 mg dose.\\nThereafter, the patient is given 50 mg per day\\nor up to 350 mg per week in three doses during\\nthe week. The first dose usually is smaller to\\nminimize naltrexoneís side effects, such as nau-\\nsea and vomiting, and to ensure that patients\\nhave been abstinent from opioids for the \\nrequisite time (Stine et al. 2003).\\nStabilization\\nThe terms ìsteady stateî and ìstabilizationî\\nshould be differentiated. Steady state is\\nachieved when a treatment medication is elimi-\\nnated from the blood at the exact rate that\\nmore is added. In contrast, a patient is stabi-\\nlized when he or she no longer exhibits drug-\\nseeking behavior or craving. The correct\\n(steady-state) medication dosage contributes to\\na patientís stabilization, but it is only one of\\nseveral factors, as discussed elsewhere in this\\nTIP . The stabilization stage of opioid pharma-\\ncotherapy focuses on finding the right dosage\\nfor each patient. The potential for undermedi-\\ncation or overmedication can be avoided by a\\nflexible approach to dosing, which sometimes\\nrequires higher dosages of treatment medica-\\ntion than expected, and by taking into account\\npatient-reported symptoms (Leavitt et al. 2000).\\nDosage determination\\nIt is critical to successful patient management in\\nMAT to determine a medication dosage that will\\nminimize withdrawal symptoms and craving\\nand decrease or eliminate opioid abuse. Dosage\\nrequirements for methadone, LAAM, and\\nbuprenorphine must be determined on an indi-\\nvidual basis. There is no single recommended\\ndosage or even a fixed range of dosages for all\\npatients. For many patients, the therapeutic\\ndosage range of methadone may be in the\\nneighborhood of 80 to 120 mg per day (Joseph\\net al. 2000), but it can be much higher, and\\noccasionally it is much lower.\\nThe desired responses to medication that \\nusually reflect optimal dosage include (Joseph\\net al. 2000)\\nï Prevention of opioid withdrawal for 24 hours\\nor longer, including both early subjective\\nsymptoms and objective signs typical of \\nabstinence\\nï Elimination of drug hunger or craving\\nï Blockade of euphoric effects of self-\\nadministered opioids (This is not a true\\nblockade like that achieved by naltrexone but\\nreflects cross-tolerance for other opioids,\\nattenuating or eliminating desired sensations\\nwhen illicit or prescription opioids are self-\\nadministered in usual ìstreet doses.î The\\nincreasing purity of heroin and availability of\\nhighly potent prescription opioids have made\\nit increasingly difficult to achieve complete\\nblockade in patients through cross-tolerance;\\nconsequently, some patients require dosages\\nconsiderably greater than 120 mg per day to\\nachieve this effect.)\\n70 Chapter 5'),\n",

However, the\\nconsensus panel recommends that OTPs avoid\\nexclusive reliance on drug test results and pre-\\nconceived notions of correct dosage; instead,\\nOTPs should determine dosage based primarily\\non patient response. Even when a medication\\ndosage is controlled for body weight (Leavitt et\\nal. 2000), patient responses, such as absence of\\nwithdrawal symptoms without oversedation and\\nremission from illicit-opioid use, are the best\\nindicators of appropriate dosage. In addition,\\nthe extent of other drug use and alcohol con-\\nsumption should be considered when determin-\\ning dosage adequacy. Finally, a patientís com-\\nplaints (or lack thereof) are also important\\nindicators of dosage adequacy. A patient can\\nexperience opioid craving or withdrawal but\\nmanage to abstain from illicit opioids. \\nMethadone. Strong evidence supports the use\\nof daily methadone doses in the range of 80 mg\\nor more for most patients (Strain et al. 1999),\\nbut considerable variability exists in patient\\nresponses. Some do well on dosages below 80 to\\n120 mg per day, and others require significant-\\nly higher dosages (Joseph et al. 2000). OTPs\\nshould exercise additional caution with higher\\ndosages, guarding against diversion of take-\\nhome methadone to individuals who are opioid\\nintolerant because higher dosages can be lethal\\nfor such individuals.\\nBuprenorphine. Buprenorphine dosage should\\nbe determined in a manner similar to that used\\nfor methadone or LAAM. The recommended\\ndosage of buprenorphine to begin stabilization\\nis 12 to 16 mg per day for most patients, with\\nincreases provided thereafter as applicable\\n(Johnson et al. 2003b). As reviewed by Johnson\\nand colleagues (2003b), if patients continue to\\nshow evidence of opioid abuse or withdrawal,\\nthe dosage should be increased using the same\\ntypes of guidelines as for methadone. For\\nexample, if the goal is to suppress opioid with-\\ndrawal symptoms, then dose increases can be\\nless frequent (e.g., weekly or biweekly) because\\nthe desired therapeutic response likely will\\nbecome detectable more slowly.\\nMost patients are likely to remain stable on 12\\nto 24 mg per day, although some might need\\ndosages of up to 32 mg per day. Increasing the\\nbuprenorphine dosage\\nto 24 mg per day or\\nhigher has been\\nshown to prolong the\\nduration of its effects\\nand usually is neces-\\nsary if patients are to\\nbe dosed every other\\nday, which is an\\noption with buprenor-\\nphine; however, such\\nan increase usually\\ndoes not increase\\nbuprenorphineís \\nopioid agonist effects\\nto the same degree\\nbecause of its partial\\nagonist properties\\n(Johnson et al.\\n2003b).

Because of the long-\\nacting nature of LAAM, a patientís reaction\\nshould be monitored closely during the first \\n2 weeks of treatment and adjustments in dosage\\nmade accordingly.\\nPatients may request transfer from methadone\\nto LAAM for various reasons: (1) to avoid the\\nhardship of methadoneís daily observed dosing,\\n(2) to provide negative drug test results at work\\n(LAAM is less likely to show up on screening\\ntests), (3) because they are not doing well on\\nmethadone (Borg et al. 2002), (4) because\\nLAAM can be less sedating, and (5) because the\\npatients are rapid metabolizers of methadone\\nand would benefit from LAAM because it is\\nlonger acting.\\nLAAM can be given every other day if an OTP\\nis open all week or three times per week (i.e.,\\ntwo 48-hour doses and one 72-hour dose) if\\nthat is more convenient.

Cross-tolerance\\noccurs when medication diminishes or prevents\\nthe euphoric effects of heroin or other short-\\nacting opioids so that patients who continue to\\nabuse opioids no longer feel ìhigh.î The medi-\\ncation dosage needed for this result depends on\\nhow long and how recently a patient has\\nabused heroin or other opioids and how much\\nhe or she has used, along with individual differ-\\nences in the level of brain receptor adaptation\\ninduced by chronic opioid use.\\nAn Australian study connected the importance\\nof dosage with patient retention in MAT\\n(Caplehorn and Bell 1991). The importance of\\nretention for successful treatment outcomes is\\ndiscussed further in chapter 8. In addition to\\nthe benefits of eliminating illicit opioids (see\\nbelow), reductions in the threats of HIV and\\nhepatitis B and C make adequate dosing and\\ntreatment retention high priorities and justify\\nadditional studies on the safety and efficacy of\\nmethadone doses exceeding 120 mg.\\nIn their classic study, Ball and Ross (1991)\\nclearly demonstrated an inverse relationship\\nbetween frequency of recent heroin use and\\nmethadone dosage.

The consensus panel\\nbelieves that increased medication dosages are\\nappropriate in such cases, although efforts also\\nshould focus on resolving the troublesome situ-\\nations such as developing ways to avoid people,\\nplaces, and things that trigger opioid craving or\\nrelapse. Conversely, diminished triggers and\\nreduced drug availability can diminish drug\\ncraving and might indicate the possibility of\\ndecreasing medication dosage if a patient prefers.\\nContingent use of dosage. The consensus panel\\nbelieves that any manipulation of dosage as\\neither a positive or a negative consequence of\\nbehavior is inappropriate and has no place in\\nMAT. The only type of contingency contracting\\nrelated to medication that should be supported\\nin MAT is that associated with take-home medi-\\ncation. Take-home medication is controlled by\\nFederal regulations, and access is based on sev-\\neral factors, including drug abstinence, OTP\\nattendance, length of time in treatment, and\\noverall functioning. An increase in medication\\ndosage should not be a reward for positive\\nbehavior change, although not everyone in the\\nMAT field shares this viewpoint. For example,\\nextensive work has demonstrated the effective-\\nness of using increased dosage (as well as extra\\ntake-home doses) as an incentive to decrease\\nsubstance abuse and increase treatment pro-\\ngram attendance (e.g., Stitzer et al. 1986, 1993;\\nsee also Petry 2000). Although the consensus\\npanel acknowledges important behavioral\\naspects of addiction and the value of contingen-\\ncy management as an aid to behavioral change,\\nusing medication dosage as a reward or punish-\\nment is considered inappropriate.\\nMaintenance\\nPharmacotherapy\\nThe maintenance stage of opioid pharma-\\ncotherapy begins when a patient is responding\\noptimally to medication treatment and routine\\ndosage adjustments are no longer needed.\\nPatients at this stage have stopped abusing \\nopioids and other substances and have resumed\\nproductive lifestyles away from the people,\\nplaces, and things associated with their addic-\\ntions. These patients typically receive scheduled\\ntake-home medication privileges. Patients who\\ncontinue to abuse substances, do not seek\\nemployment, or remain connected to their drug-\\nusing social networks have not reached this\\nstage. Along with continued observed medication\\ntreatment, these latter patients are candidates\\nfor intensified counseling and other services to\\nhelp them reach the maintenance stage.\\nDuring the maintenance stage, many patients\\nremain on the same dosage of treatment medi-\\ncation for many months, whereas others\\nrequire frequent or occasional adjustments.\\nPeriods of increased stress, strenuous physical\\nlabor, negative environmental factors, greater\\ndrug availability, pregnancy, or increased drug\\nhunger can reawaken the need for increased\\ndosages over short or extended periods. Serious\\nemotional crises may require long-term or \\ntemporary dosage adjustments. Although the\\ncounseling relationship and patient interview'),\n",

They might believe that\\nthey can get by on less medication, or they\\nmight be responding to external pressures.\\nPatients often perceive that those on lower\\ndosages are ìbetter patients.î These situations\\nrequire physicians or other staff members to\\neducate patients and their significant others\\nabout the importance of adequate dosage and\\nhow individual differences in absorption, body\\nweight, metabolism, and tolerance can affect\\nthe dosage necessary to achieve stability\\n(Leavitt et al. 2000).\\nVoluntary Tapering and\\nDosage Reduction\\nFor various reasons, some patients attempt\\nreduction or cessation of maintenance medica-\\ntion. Some studies indicate high relapse rates,\\noften 80 percent or more, for this group,\\nincluding patients judged to be rehabilitated\\nbefore tapering (e.g., Magura and Rosenblum\\n2001). However, the likelihood of successful\\ndose tapering also depends on individual fac-\\ntors such as motivation and family support.\\nThe possibility of relapse should be explained\\nto patients who want to dose taper, especially\\nthose who are not stable on their current\\ndosage, as part of the informed-consent pro-\\ncess. Patients who choose tapering should be\\nmonitored closely and taught relapse preven-\\ntion strategies. They and their families should\\nbe aware of risk factors for relapse during and\\nafter tapering. If relapse occurs or is likely,\\nadditional therapeutic measures can be taken,\\nincluding rapid resumption of MAT when\\nappropriate (American Society of Addiction\\nMedicine 1997).\\nIdeally, withdrawal should be attempted when\\nit is desired strongly by a stable patient who\\nhas a record of abstinence and has adjusted\\npositively on MAT. However, sometimes dose\\ntapering is necessary for administrative rea-\\nsons, such as a response to extreme antisocial\\nbehavior, noncompliance with minimal pro-\\ngram standards, or a move to a location where\\nMAT is unavailable. In such cases, providers\\nshould refer patients to other programs that\\nare more reasonable and practical in terms of\\nthe patientsí overall situation (e.g., motivation,\\nresource availability, ability to pay).\\nIn a review of research on withdrawal from\\nMAT, Magura and Rosenblum (2001) noted\\nthat many treatment providers lacked effective\\nways to improve outcomes for patients who\\nundertook planned withdrawal and that opioid\\ncraving remained prevalent in this group, even\\nafter successful physiological withdrawal. They\\nconcluded, therefore, that planned withdrawal\\nfrom opioid pharmacotherapy should be\\nundertaken conservatively.\\nRelapse prevention techniques should be \\nincorporated into counseling and other support\\nservices both before and during dosage reduc-\\ntion. Such structured techniques can be useful\\nsafeguards in preventing and preparing for\\nrelapse. Use of mutual-help techniques (see\\nchapter 8) is recommended highly, especially\\nduring dosage reduction.\\nAlthough most data about outcomes after\\ntapering from opioid medication come from\\nstudies of methadone maintenance, the consen-\\nsus panel believes that success rates are likely\\nto be similar for patients who taper from\\nbuprenorphine or LAAM, and similar cautions\\nand monitoring processes should be in place.\\nMethadone dosage reduction\\nThe techniques and rates of graded methadone\\nreduction vary widely among patients. One\\ncommon practice is to reduce daily doses in\\nroughly 5- to 10-percent increments with 1 to 2\\nweeks between reductions, adjusting as needed\\nfor patient conditions. Because reductions'),\n",

A slow withdrawal gives\\npatients and staff time to stop the tapering or\\nresume maintenance if tapering is not working\\nand relapse seems likely.\\nRegardless of the rate of withdrawal from\\nmethadone, a point usually is reached at which\\nsteady-state occupancy of opiate receptors is no\\nlonger complete and discomfort, often with\\ndrug hunger and craving, emerges. This point\\nmay occur at any dosage but is more common\\nwith methadone when the dosage is below 40\\nmg per day.

Blind dosage reduction is appropri-\\nate only if requested by a patient. It should be\\ndiscussed and agreed on before it is implement-\\ned. It is inappropriate, clinically and ethically,\\nto withdraw a patient from maintenance medi-\\ncation without his or her knowledge and con-\\nsent. The consensus panel recommends that\\nOTP staff always disclose dosing information\\nunless patients have given specific informed\\nconsent and have requested that providers not\\ntell them their exact dosages.\\nWithdrawal and termination\\nfrom LAAM maintenance\\nFew studies have addressed medically super-\\nvised withdrawal from LAAM. Because LAAM\\nis longer acting than methadone, withdrawal\\nshould be expected to have a delayed onset and\\nprotracted course,\\nalthough symptoms\\nmight be less intense\\nthan with other opi-\\noids. Patients tend to\\ndislike longer periods\\nof withdrawal,\\nregardless of symptom\\nintensity. Special\\ncounseling might be\\nneeded to address \\nthis aspect of with-\\ndrawal from LAAM.\\nFor patients on\\nLAAM who wish to be\\nmedication free,\\ndosage can be\\nreduced gradually at\\na rate determined by\\ntheir response. Patients who prefer less \\nprotracted withdrawal can be converted to and\\nthen tapered from methadone.

Regulations specify two kinds of\\ndetoxification with methadone: short-term\\ntreatment of less than 30 days and long-term\\ntreatment of 30 to 180 days.

Level of care refers to the intensity of a\\ntreatment (in terms of frequency, type of serviceóindividual, group,\\nfamilyóand medication) and the type of setting needed for treatment\\ndelivery. For information on criteria and methods to determine levels of\\ncare in substance abuse treatment, see the American Society of\\nAddiction Medicine (ASAM) patient placement criteria (Mee-Lee et al.\\n2001b). As explained by Mee Lee and colleagues (2001b), the ASAM\\nmodel conceptualizes opioid pharmacotherapy as a service that can be\\nprovided at any level of care, although it is delivered most often in an\\noutpatient setting (i.e., ASAM level I).\\nThe chapter also provides information on developing a treatment plan\\nwith short- and long-range goals for each patient. In some cases,\\npatientñtreatment matching and treatment planning involve changes that\\ncan move a patient out of comprehensive MAT to a setting that better\\nmeets the patientís needs. Because this TIP is primarily about outpatient\\nMAT in OTPs, other settings and programs are discussed only briefly.\\nIn general, patientñtreatment matching involves individualizing, to the\\nextent possible, the choice and application of treatment resources to\\neach patientís needs. The chapter explains recommended elements of a\\npatientñtreatment-matching process, including ways to accommodate\\nspecial populations with distinct needs and orientations that affect their\\nresponses to specific treatments and settings.\\nPatients enter OTPs at various points along a continuum of substance\\nabuse and addiction. Many also have co-occurring medical and mental\\nhealth conditions that can be lifelong. Because of the complexity of\\npatientsí circumstances and needs and the range of services required to\\naddress these needs, MAT includes not only opioid pharmacotherapy\\nbut also other forms of treatment in a comprehensive treatment program\\n87'),\n",

Such pro-\\ngrams provide social support from others who\\nare in recovery from addiction (Washton 1988).\\nMany patients in MAT participate in mutual-\\nhelp groups. However, patients with opioid\\naddiction who are maintained on treatment\\nmedication can feel out of place in some group\\nsettings where continued opioid pharmacother-\\napy may be misunderstood.

Chapter 8 presents some of\\nthese strategies.\\nMatching Treatment Service\\nNeeds to Settings\\nAfter the types and intensities of services that\\npatients need are defined, the next crucial step\\nin patientñtreatment matching is to identify the\\nmost appropriate available setting or settings\\nfor these services.

Many physi-\\ncians who treat pain do not have the necessary\\neducation to treat pain in this population\\n(Prater et al. 2002). MAT providers should\\nevaluate patient treatment needs for pain \\nmanagement and assist patients directly in\\nobtaining optimal pain treatment. Medical\\nproviders in MAT should work collaboratively\\nwith primary care providers and pain and \\npalliative-care clinicians to ensure establish-\\nment of appropriate pain interventions for\\npatients in MAT.

This role,\\nwhich places great responsibility on the coun-\\nselor, usually incorporates cognitive behavioral\\napproaches in which providers strive to\\nenhance patient motivation for change by\\nfocusing on patient strengths and respecting\\npatient decisions (CSAT 1999a). To engage\\npatients in the process of treatment planning,\\ncounselors should encourage the inclusion of\\nmotivational enhancement strategies that high-\\nlight appropriate, realistic treatment goals (Di\\nClemente 1991). Research has shown that con-\\nfrontational counseling or the use of negative\\ncontingencies often predicts treatment failure\\n(Miller and Rollnick 2002). \\nRole of the patient in plan\\nformulation\\nA patient in MAT should be an integral mem-\\nber of the treatment team with his or her needs\\nand expectations considered respectfully and\\nincorporated into the treatment plan. Patients\\nwho agree with the treatment rationale or ther-\\napeutic approach tend to experience increased\\ndetermination to improve (Hubble et al. 1999).\\nA patientís participation in treatment planning\\ncan enhance motivation to adhere to change\\nstrategies, leading to positive treatment out-\\ncomes such as higher rates of abstinence and\\nbetter social adjustment (CSAT 1999a). When\\npossible, the treatment plan should be written\\nin a patientís own words to describe his or her\\nunique strengths, needs, abilities, and prefer-\\nences as well as his or her challenges and \\nproblems. The plan also should contain \\nmutually approved goals that reflect awareness\\nof and sensitivity to a patientís informed \\nchoices, cultural background, age, and medical\\nstatus or disability. \\nOther factors in plan \\nformulation\\nTreatment plans should incorporate an \\nassessment of linguistic and cultural factors\\nthat might affect treatment and recovery either\\npositively or negatively (U.S. Department of\\nHealth and Human Services 2001). Treatment\\nproviders should work collaboratively with\\npatients to identify health-related cultural\\nbeliefs, values, and practices and to decide how\\nto address these factors in the treatment plan\\n(U.S. Department of Health and Human\\nServices 2001).\\nMotivation for treatment\\nPatient motivational strategies should be incor-\\nporated throughout the treatment plan. As part\\nof this process, the treatment team can benefit\\nfrom an understanding of stages of change and\\ntheir effects on patient progress.

An earlier stage (precontemplation)\\nalso plays a role.

Patients should be monitored closely\\nfor symptoms that interfere with treatment\\nbecause immediate intervention might prevent\\npatient dropout. Such disorders can be \\ndisruptive at the start of MAT and require\\nimmediate treatment. The course of recovery\\nfrom substance-induced co-occurring disorders\\nusually follows that of the substance use dis-\\norder itself, and these co-occurring disorders\\ntypically do not require ongoing treatment after\\nthe acute phase. Some patients may require\\nfocused, short-term pharmacotherapy, psycho-\\ntherapy, or both. However, many patients \\nmay have co-occurring disorders requiring a\\nthorough psychiatric evaluation and long-term\\ntreatment to improve their quality of life. (See\\nchapters 4 and 12 for more information on\\nassessing these conditions and chapter 12 for\\nmore information on psychiatric diagnosis and\\ntreatment in MAT.)\\nMedical and dental problems\\nPatients often present with longstanding,\\nneglected medical problems.

Evidence\\nof heavy alcohol use might warrant that a\\npatient return to the acute phase. If a patient is\\nusing medications, particularly drugs of poten-\\ntial abuse prescribed by a nonprogram physi-\\ncian, the patient should be counseled to advise\\nhis or her OTP physician of these prescriptions\\nand should sign an informed consent statement\\npermitting OTP staff and the outside physician\\nto discuss these prescriptions. If drug use is\\nillicit or unapproved by the OTP physician,\\nthen group, family, and individual counseling\\nshould continue, and the patient should remain\\nin the rehabilitative phase. Patients who con-\\ntinue to use illicit drugs or demonstrate alcohol\\nuse problems are not eligible for take-home\\nmedication.

With proper support systems and skills,\\nmany patients succeed in remaining abstinent\\nfrom opioids without treatment medication for\\nyears or even life, but studies have shown that\\nsome relapse to opioid abuse (Condelli and\\nDunteman 1993; Hubbard et al. 1989; Kreek\\n1987). Chapter 5 describes procedures and\\nother key considerations in tapering. In the\\nphased model presented here, tapering is con-\\nsidered an optional branch.\\nIt is important that any decision to taper from\\nopioid treatment medication be made without\\ncoercion and include careful consideration of a\\npatientís wishes and preferences, level of moti-\\nvation, length of addiction, results of previous\\nattempts at tapering, family involvement and\\nstability, and disengagement from activities\\nwith others who use substances. A patient con-\\nsidering dose tapering should understand that\\nthe chance of relapse to drug use remains\\n(Magura and Rosenblum 2001) and some level\\nof discomfort exists even if the dose is reduced\\nslowly over months (Moolchan and Hoffman\\n1994). Patients should be assured that they\\ntemporarily can halt the reductions or return\\nto a previous methadone dosage if tapering\\ncauses problems.\\nAs medication is being tapered, intensified ser-\\nvices should be provided, including counseling\\nand monitoring of patientsí behavioral and\\nemotional conditions. Patients considered for\\nmedication tapering should demonstrate suffi-\\ncient motivation to undertake this process,\\nincluding acceptance of the need for increased\\ncounseling. Tapering from medication can be\\ndifficult, and patients should understand the\\nadvantages and disadvantages of both tapering\\nfrom and continuing on medication mainte-\\nnance as they decide which path is best for\\nthem. Exhibit 7-5 presents treatment issues\\nduring the tapering phase, strategies to address\\nthese issues, and indicators for return to a pre-\\nvious phase.\\nReasons for tapering\\nSometimes decisions to taper are motivated by\\nthe hardships of OTP attendance and other\\nrequirements or by the stigma often associated\\nwith MAT. The consensus panel urges OTPs to\\nidentify such situational motives and ensure\\nthat patients who choose medically supervised\\nwithdrawal from MAT are motivated instead by\\nlegitimate concerns about health and relapse.\\nPatients and treatment providers might fail to\\nrealize or understand that continuing or long-\\nterm MAT is the best choice for some patients.\\nOTP staff members consciously or inadvertent-\\nly might convey that tapering is more desirable\\nor expected than continuing opioid pharma-\\ncotherapy, through such practices as celebrat-\\ning patientsí tapering but not the accomplish-\\nments of others who successfully continue in\\nMAT. The consensus panel believes that a basic\\ngrounding in MAT pharmacology, the biology\\nof addiction, and the endorphin system helps\\npatients and treatment providers understand\\nthat both successful tapering from and contin-\\nued compliance with medical maintenance\\ntreatment are legitimate goals and commend-\\nable accomplishments.\\nRelapse after tapering\\nThe risk of relapse during and after tapering is\\nsignificant because of the physical and emotion-\\nal stress of attempting to discontinue medica-\\ntion (Magura and Rosenblum 2001). The con-\\nsensus panel recommends that patients be\\nencouraged to discuss any difficulties they\\nexperience with tapering and readjustment so\\nthat appropriate action can be taken to avoid\\nrelapse. Patients should be persuaded to\\nreturn to a previous phase if the need is indi-\\ncated at any time during tapering. Patients also\\nshould be told that they can taper at their own\\nrate, that successful tapering sometimes takes\\nmany months, and that they can stop tapering\\nor increase their dosage at any time without a\\nsense of failure. Patients should be educated\\nabout how to reenter MAT if they believe that\\nrelapse is imminent.\\nPhases of Treatment'),\n",

Treatment\\nat this stage comprises ongoing medical fol-\\nlowup by a primary care physician, occasional\\ncheck-ins with an OTP counselor, and partici-\\npation in recovery groups.

In addition,\\nadolescent and young adult patients often\\nsmoke or snort rather than inject heroin, and\\nmore patients are addicted to opioid analgesics,\\nsuch as oxycodone, taken orally (see chapter\\n11). To manage these developments, OTPs\\nshould evaluate and modify their core sub-\\nstance abuse treatment services continuously,\\nbased on the changing needs of their patient\\npopulations.\\nMedical needs\\nPeople addicted to opioids are at greater risk\\nfor sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), pneu-\\nmonia, and other debilitating conditions that\\nrequire intensive medical services. Infected\\ninjection sites, cellulitis, and abscesses are\\nincreasingly common. Bacterial endocarditis\\nremains a concern. Long-term tobacco use con-\\ntributes to other diseases.

Another factor found to affect retention\\nwas motivation or readiness for treatment (Joe\\net al. 1998).\\nIn other studies, how patients entered OTPs,\\nwhether voluntarily or by a court referral, did\\nnot affect treatment retention (Brooner et al.\\n1998; Fallon 2001). Rhoades and colleagues\\n(1998) reported that patients who previously\\nreceived methadone were more likely to remain\\nin MAT than first-time patients. Some patients\\nrequire several attempts at treatment before\\nbecoming stabilized for extended periods\\n(Koester et al. 1999). OTPs should not consider\\npatientsí prior failures indicative of future\\ncompliance or retention or use these failures as\\nreasons to reject those seeking readmission.\\nSome patients may need longer periods of\\nadjustment to MAT before making a long-term\\ncommitment.\\nRecommended steps to\\nimprove patient retention\\nIndividualize medication dosages. Adequate,\\nindividualized medication dosages are probably\\nthe most important factor in patient retention\\n(Joseph et al. 2000) because they contribute to\\npatient comfort and satisfaction by reducing\\nwithdrawal symptoms and craving and enabling\\nmore attention to other concerns (reviewed in\\nLeavitt et al. 2000; Strain et al. 1999).

Patients with poor attention\\nstamina were found to have greater success in\\nmapping-enhanced counseling than in standard\\ncounseling (Czuchry and Dansereau 2003).\\nLess educated patients exposed to mapping-\\nenhanced counseling also had better 12-month\\nfollowups than those in standard counseling\\n(Pitre et al. 1996).

It is\\ncritical that a counselor or therapist know\\nthese warning signs, including the following\\n(Washton 1988):\\nï The illusion of feeling cured after a few weeks\\nor months of abstinence\\nï The belief that one can control his or her\\nsubstance use and can use substances socially\\nï Idealized recollections of drug-induced eupho-\\nria; remembering the pleasurable effects but\\nselectively forgetting adverse effects\\nï Overreactions to urges and cravings, leading\\nto beliefs that treatment is ineffective or\\nabstinence is unsustainable\\nï Denial of vulnerability to and refusal to\\naccept the possibility of relapse, leading to\\noverreaction when relapse occurs (causing\\npatients to drop out of treatment)\\nï Entry into high-risk situations, denial of\\nrisks, and self-testing or self-sabotage.\\nExtinction Therapy\\nBehavior therapy using cue exposure treatment\\n(extinction) was designed to reduce drug craving\\nby repeated exposures to an experience that\\npreviously triggered drug use (Childress et al.\\n1992). However, a recent review of cue exposure\\ntreatment for relapse prevention concluded\\nthat these treatments, although studied for\\nyears, were ineffective (Conklin and Tiffany\\n2002). \\nPatient Followup Strategies\\nPatient followup and continuing care have been\\nfound to be critical to preventing relapse and\\nensuring that patients remain abstinent (e.g.,\\nZanis et al. 1996). When relapse occurs, OTPs\\nshould facilitate reentry into MAT. Followup\\nand continuing-care services ensure a continu-\\num of support, and the consensus panel recom-\\nmends that these efforts continue, with neces-\\nsary funding to sustain them. (See the discus-\\nsion of the continuing-care phase of treatment\\nin chapter 7.)\\nReferral to Social\\nServices\\nMost patients in MAT need vocational, educa-\\ntional, housing, or other social services. One\\nreview found that an estimated 50 to 80 percent\\nof patients in publicly funded OTPs were\\nunemployed, yet fewer than 5 percent received\\nemployment-related interventions (Zanis and\\nCoviello 2001). In another study, social services\\nother than Temporary Assistance for Needy\\nFamilies (Public Law 104ñ193) often were less\\nreadily available to patients in MAT (Widman\\net al. 1997). OTPs should be proactive in edu-\\ncating social service providers about patient\\nneeds and facilitating these services. Patients in\\nOTPs that provide assistance with social ser-\\nvices have shown improved outcomes after\\ntreatment (Rowan-Szal et al. 2000a).\\nInvoluntary Discharge\\nFrom MAT\\nUnfortunately, involuntary discharge from\\nMAT, sometimes called administrative dis-\\ncharge, occurs frequently. The consensus panel\\nbelieves that these discharges are, in many\\ncases, evidence of program shortcomings. A\\nnumber of recent changes, including the'),\n",

Important changes have\\noccurred in current knowledge about and methods for drug testing in\\nopioid treatment programs (OTPs) since the publication of TIP 1, State\\nMethadone Treatment Guidelines(CSAT 1993b). Testing now is per-\\nformed extensively to detect substance use and monitor treatment com-\\npliance. Analysis of test results provides guidance for OTP accreditation,\\nas well as information for program planning and performance improve-\\nment. In addition, other agencies concerned with patient progress (e.g.,\\nchild welfare and criminal justice agencies) routinely request and use\\ndrug test results with patientsí informed consent (see CSAT 2004b).\\nIncreasing emphasis on treatment outcomes as evidence of program\\neffectiveness has added significance to drug tests in OTPs.\\nAdministrators use drug test results in response to quality assurance\\nrequirements. For example, an OTP that prescribes adequate mainte-\\nnance medication should report relatively few illicit-opioid-positive drug\\ntests. Ball and Ross (1991) found that the most effective programs had\\nless than 10-percent positive tests. However, these findings emerged\\nbefore the purity of heroin markedly increased in recent years and\\nbefore the ratio of OTP staff to patients decreased in many programs as\\na result of funding cuts. These events have been associated with increases\\nin opioid positive urine tests in most OTPs. Given the regional variability\\nin factors affecting addiction, for example, differences in heroin purity\\nand availability or in prescription opioid abuse, the consensus panel \\nrecommends that OTPs develop new measures to improve outcomes if\\nthey report an average of more than 20-percent positive drug tests for\\npatients with at least 1 to 3 years of MAT. Equally important, OTP drug\\ntest results should be nearly 100-percent positive for treatment medica-\\ntion because lower percentages could indicate medication diversion,\\nwhich requires investigation and a corrective-action plan. (Federal regu-\\nlations require OTPs to maintain diversion control plans as part of their\\nquality assurance efforts [see chapter 14].)'),\n",

However,\\nblood testing is\\nimpractical, costly,\\nand difficult, and\\nthe same investiga-\\ntors recognized that\\nurine drug testing is\\nlikely to be the domi-\\nnant method in\\nOTPs for the fore-\\nseeable future.\\nSome investigators\\nevaluating optimal\\napproaches to\\nassessing MAT com-\\npliance and deter-\\nmining continued\\nsubstance use have\\nfound patients forth-\\ncoming about their\\ndrug use and not\\nparticularly motivated to avoid detection. Two\\nstudies evaluated patientsí self-reports of drug\\nuse and concluded that they are at least as reli-\\nable as urine drug tests (Zanis et al. 1994) and\\nsometimes more sensitive (Howard et al. 1995).\\nBoth studies suggested that a combination of\\nself-reporting and urine testing is more useful\\nthan either alone. Another study (Katz and\\nFanciullo 2002) has challenged these findings.\\nUrine Drug Testing\\nDespite its limitations, urine drug testing is\\ndominant in OTPs because obtaining specimens\\nis relatively easy (Moolchan et al. 2001) and\\ntesting is affordable. In addition, the technique\\nis well studied, has been in use for a long time,\\nand has well-established cutoff levels and other\\nlaboratory guidelines (Cone and Preston 2002).\\nAccording to one survey (Jones et al. 1994),\\nmost patients accept urine testing in an OTP\\nalthough many do not like it. Concerns usually\\nrelate to the specimen collection process or the\\nsensitivity and specificity of results, as well as\\nthe possibility of tampering, the need to pre-\\nserve patient privacy and dignity, risks of col-\\nlection to staff, and the possibility that sub-\\nstance interactions may confound results.\\nA patientís physical condition can affect test\\nsensitivity and specificity. Urine testing is not\\nfeasible for patients with renal failure (e.g.,\\nthose on dialysis) or other bladder control\\nimpairments. George and Braithwaite (1999)\\nfound that variations in metabolism and excre-\\ntion could affect urine concentrations of\\nmethadone or its metabolites. Moolchan and\\ncolleagues (2001) noted that renal methadone\\nclearance varies for subjects with certain medi-\\ncal conditions (e.g., renal disease) and those\\ntaking other prescribed or illicit drugs. As a\\nresult, urine drug tests for patients on relative-\\nly low methadone dosages may be methadone\\nnegative even though subjects have ingested\\nmedication as prescribed (i.e., a false negative\\nresult).

According\\nto SAMHSAís interim guidance on the use of\\noral-fluid testing in OTPs, sent to OTPs in July\\n2003 (Clark 2003), offsite drug testing using\\noral fluid may be considered adequate for the\\npurpose of 42 CFR, Part 8 ß 12(f)(6). The\\nchoice of drug-testing methodology is an\\ninformed medical judgment decision. It is\\nSAMHSAís view that there is sufficient infor-\\nmation to confirm the adequacy of oral-fluid\\ntesting in the OTP setting. CSAT noted that\\nOTPs still must conform to State laws and \\nregulations in this area (Clark 2003).\\nMany patients in OTPs react more favorably to\\nthe use of oral swabs than to observed urine\\ncollection. Researchers have confirmed other\\nbenefits of oral-fluid testing. Moore and col-\\nleagues (2001) reported that it was highly sensi-\\ntive and specific for methadone and opioids of\\nabuse and that samples could be stored or sent\\nto a laboratory for analysis. Braithwaite and\\ncolleagues (1995) noted that oral-fluid testing\\nensured privacy and was less susceptible to\\ntampering than urine testing and that speci-\\nmens required little preparation.\\nResults of oral-fluid testing generally are \\nsimilar to those obtained by urine drug testing,\\nbut differences exist, and OTP staff members\\nshould understand these differences. Concen-\\ntrations of some substances are lower in saliva\\nthan in urine. Some drugs remain detectable\\nlonger in urine than in saliva. Drug residue in\\nthe oral or nasal cavity was found to contami-\\nnate saliva specimens (Swotinsky and Smith\\n1999). The consensus panel recommends oral-\\nfluid testing when drug testing must be\\nobserved because it is more respectful and less\\ninvasive and observation does not require\\nwatching patients void. Oral-fluid collection\\nrequires no temperature strips or other devices\\nto ensure that a specimen was just provided.\\nBlood Drug Testing\\nOTPs rarely if ever use blood testing routinely;\\nmost often, they use this method to monitor\\nplasma methadone levels when necessary.\\nTesting for the presence of methadone in\\nserum, although more costly than urine testing,\\nis the most accurate method currently available\\nto determine whether other prescribed medica-\\ntions influence methadone metabolism or a\\npatient is a rapid metabolizer. Serum testing is\\nmore accurate than other methods to address\\nissues related to the effects of metabolism on\\nmethadone dosage. \\nBlood testing has limitations besides cost.\\nBlood offers a smaller drug detection window\\nthan oral fluid or urine; most drugs are unde-\\ntectable in blood after 12 hours (DuPont 1999).\\nTrained personnel must obtain blood speci-\\nmens. Concerns about blood-borne pathogens\\nmake routine blood testing impractical, and, as\\ndiscussed in chapter 3, some medications and\\ndiseases affect methadone levels in plasma.\\nSweat Drug Testing\\nSweat patches usually are used as an adjunct to\\nother forms of testing. They provide a longer\\nspecimen collection period than either urine or\\nblood and may be less susceptible to tampering\\nthan urine. Sweat patches are tolerated well by\\npatients and are considered less invasive and\\nless potentially embarrassing. Taylor and col-\\nleagues (1998) found that women were more\\nlikely than men to prefer a sweat patch to urine\\ntesting. The patch has not been found to deter\\nsubstance use (Taylor et al. 1998).

In their review of avail-\\nable commercial analytical methods, they found\\nthat all were rapid, reliable, and useful but\\nrequired confirmation of positive results, and\\nsome lacked sensitivity, specificity, or both. A\\nmore recent review by George and Braithwaite\\n(2002, p. 1639) concluded that onsite analytical\\ndevices for drugs of abuse were ìan expensive\\nand potentially inaccurate means to monitor\\npatient treatment and drug abuse states.î \\nOnsite analysis of test specimens also requires\\nthat staff be trained in calibration of the testing\\ndevice and interpretation of results.

SAMHSA-approved accrediting bodies\\npay particular attention to drug test results and\\nwhether an OTP appropriately monitors and\\nfollows up with patients who receive take-home\\nmedications (see chapter 5). The accrediting\\nbodies require all OTPs to develop and imple-\\nment a diversion control plan as part of their\\nquality assurance program and to integrate the\\nplan into both patient and staff orientations.\\nThe diversion control plan must contain specif-\\nic measures to reduce the possibility of \\ndiversion and assign specific implementation\\nresponsibility to medical and administrative\\nstaff (see chapter 14). \\nDecisions About Take-Home\\nMedication\\nAlthough drug test reports are a key factor in\\ntake-home medication decisions, OTPs should\\nconsider and docu-\\nment other considera-\\ntions, such as employ-\\nment and medical\\nproblems.

Even\\nwhen people with difficult medical problems\\nare admitted to an OTP , unavailable or frag-\\nmented medical and psychiatric services may\\ncause these patients to leave MAT prematurely,\\nrelapse to substance use, or resort increasingly\\nto inpatient, emergency, or other expensive \\nservices because proactive care is lacking.\\nThe consensus panel believes that many medi-\\ncal problems associated with opioid addiction\\nshould be treated either within the OTP or\\nthrough liaisons with outside specialists and\\nprograms. One ran-\\ndomized, controlled\\ntrial in a large health\\nmaintenance organi-\\nzation showed that\\nintegrating addiction\\ntreatment and medi-\\ncal care was cost\\neffective and\\nimproved patient\\noutcomes (Weisner et\\nal. 2001). Integrating\\nmedical and addic-\\ntion treatments is\\nboth a challenge and\\nan opportunity to\\nmatch strategies for\\nmore cost-effective\\ninterventions.\\nMedical services for\\nat least the most\\ncommon problems\\n(such as soft-tissue\\ninfections, hepatitis,\\nHIV infection,\\nhypertension, diabetes, and COPD) should be\\nprovided at the OTP with expansion to other\\nmedical services as resources permit. Several\\nstudies have shown the public health benefits of\\nthis arrangement (e.g., Batki et al. 2002;\\nUmbricht-Schneiter et al. 1994). \\nThe consensus panel recommends that each\\nOTP clearly define the medical services it\\noffers on site versus by referral. Safety, practi-\\ncality, and efficacy are important considera-\\ntions in these decisions. For example, patients\\nneeding treatment for acute conditions such as\\nbacterial endocarditis, those needing treatment\\nfor severe liver disease, or those requiring\\nobstetric and gynecologic services generally are\\nreferred to primary or specialty care providers\\nbecause most OTPs lack the resources to pro-\\nvide those services. The panel recommends that\\nOTPs establish sound links with medical\\nproviders and programs skilled in treating\\nproblems that go beyond the direct services of\\nthe OTPs.\\nIt is important for patients to understand an\\nOTPís policies regarding services provided on\\nsite versus by referral. For example, an OTP\\nmight offer testing for infectious diseases but\\nrefer patients for treatment of these diseases.\\nSuch distinctions, as well as whether and how\\nstaff members will follow up to ensure that\\npatients comply with offsite treatment, should\\nbe clear. Referral services should be part of a\\npatientís opioid addiction treatment plan. The\\nconsensus panel recommends that primary care\\nresponsibility be established either on site or\\nthrough a community provider because special-\\nists are more likely to accept patients if their\\nprimary care responsibility has been assigned.\\nOTPs also should inform local hospitals about\\ntheir services and willingness to provide medi-\\ncal information (e.g., dosage information for\\naddiction treatment medications, assuming a\\npatientís informed consent) when a patient in\\nMAT is admitted to a hospital for medical\\ntreatment.\\nIn many cases, patients need help to under-\\nstand their testing and treatment experiences at\\nother sites, and they may feel uncomfortable\\nasking offsite providers questions.

Some of these conditions can\\nmimic opioid or intoxication withdrawal. In\\nmany cases, patients may be unaware of the\\nseverity of their conditions or may attribute\\ntheir symptoms to withdrawal. Because patients\\nare focused on avoiding withdrawal, their\\ndescriptions of their histories may be unhelpful.\\nThe most common of these life-threatening \\nconditions are discussed below.\\nEndocarditis\\nEndocarditis is an infection, usually bacterial,\\nof the inner lining of the heart and its valves. A\\ndiagnosis of possible endocarditis should be\\nconsidered in any patient with recent injection\\nmarks and fever or a newly appearing heart\\nmurmur. A history of previously treated endo-\\ncarditis might produce persistent heart mur-\\nmur.

It is uncommon, and cases caused by\\nother bacteria also have been reported (Noone\\net al. 2002). The infection spreads along tissue\\nplanes and can cause death from overwhelming\\nsepsis within days without much evidence of\\ninflammation. Some patients may lose large\\nareas of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and even\\nmuscle, requiring grafting. Case fatality rates\\nfrom 20 to more than 50 percent have been\\nreported (Mulla 2004).

However, directly observed treat-\\nment for eligible patients should be optional.\\nAddiction treatment medications should not be\\nwithheld to ensure adherence to TB medications.\\nIsoniazid is effective in TB prevention but can\\ncause liver toxicity (Centers for Disease Control\\nand Prevention 2000).

Hepatitis A can cause serious morbidity\\nand mortality in patients already infected with\\nhepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus\\n(HCV). OTPs should screen for hepatitis A\\nvirus (HAV) and provide vaccination services\\nor referral to such services for individuals who\\nare unexposed.\\nHepatitis B\\nFifty to seventy percent of people who begin\\ninjecting drugs contract hepatitis B within 5\\nyears, accounting for 17 percent of all new\\ncases in 2000 (Centers for Disease Control \\nand Prevention 2003d). This prevalence is \\nparticularly disturbing because vaccination can\\nprevent HBV infection. In people with chronic\\nHBV infection, both active and carrier states\\nare marked by persistent surface antigen\\nexpression. A chronic carrier is someone who\\nremains positive for serum hepatitis B surface\\nantigen for 6 months or more. Recovery is\\nmarked by the disappearance of surface anti-\\ngen, which is replaced by surface antibody.\\nCore antibody (antibody to HBV core proteins)\\nis present whenever patients are infected with\\nHBV , regardless of outcome.

When\\nHCV antibody test results are negative, it is\\nimportant to educate patients about HCVís\\nhigh transmissibility. The main method of\\ntransmission in this group is injection drug use\\n(National Institutes of Health 2002). Hepatitis\\nC is transmitted more than hepatitis A or B \\nor HIV/AIDS. In one study, most subjects\\nbecame infected with HCV within the first 2\\nyears of injection drug use (Thomas et al.\\n1995). Hepatitis C also can be acquired\\nthrough sexual transmission. However, this is\\nmuch less efficient than the parenteral route.\\nSexual transmission of HCV occurs more fre-\\nquently in HIV-infected individuals than in\\nother individuals.\\nDetermination of HCV disease activity. A \\npositive HCV antibody test indicates patient\\nexposure to HCV . Further evaluation should\\ndetermine whether HCV infection has self-\\nresolved (cleared) or is chronic. Approximately\\n15 to 25 percent of patients exposed to HCV\\nclear their infections. To determine whether\\nHCV infection still is present, a test for HCV\\nribonucleic acid is required. This test uses\\npolymerase chain reaction and is costly, pre-\\nsenting a significant barrier for patients with-\\nout health insurance. Detection of liver\\nenzymes is a cheaper test but is insufficient to\\ndetect the virus. Twenty-five to fifty percent of\\npeople with HCV infection have normal liver\\nenzymes (Inglesby et al. 1999). Patients with\\nchronic hepatitis C infection may have few or\\nno symptoms, so they have little incentive to\\nincur further expense and visit their physicians.\\nThe consensus panel recommends that OTPs\\nprovide patients who are HCV positive with\\nadvice on minimizing their risk of liver \\ndamage, as well as encouragement to be evalu-\\nated further. These patients should know that \\nalcohol ingestion significantly worsens hepatitis\\nC (Regev and Jeffers 1999). They also should\\nbe tested and receive vaccinations for HAV and\\nHBV infections if they have not been vaccinated.\\nBecause acute hepatitis A can be severe among\\nHCV-infected patients, hepatitis A vaccination\\nis recommended for all persons who are HCV\\ninfected. Many standard ìhepatitis panelî\\nblood tests include a test for HAV antibody. In\\naddition, patients who are HCV-antibody posi-\\ntive should avoid high doses of acetaminophen\\nbecause it can cause liver damage, and their\\nHCV antibody status should be communicated\\nto any physician prescribing medication so that\\nliver-toxic drugs are avoided (Thomas et al.\\n2000).\\nIn contrast to HIV , the viral load of HCV does\\nnot correlate with its liver disease severity. For\\npatients who have quantitative HCV , a complete\\nevaluation of liver disease includes determina-\\ntion of liver enzymes and a liver biopsy (Saadeh\\net al. 2001). Virus genotyping is important if\\npharmacotherapy is considered because the\\nresults indicate the optimal length of treatment.\\nTreatment decisions are not based on patientsí\\nsymptoms but on HCV genotype, level of liver\\ndisease, co-occurring illnesses, and willingness\\nto undergo treatment.

Some medications, such\\nas fluconazole, increase methadone levels, and\\nothers, such as nevirapine, efavirenz, and\\nritonavir, lower them. These authors pointed\\nout that decisions about raising or lowering\\nmethadone dosages for patients in MAT who\\nare HIV positive should be based on observa-\\ntion during the first month of any treatment\\nchange because some patients react differently\\nthan indicated by published information\\n(Gourevitch and Friedland 2000). If necessary,\\npeak and trough blood levels can be drawn and\\nsplit dosing provided accordingly.\\nNeurologic complications of\\nAIDS and its treatment\\nPain from neuropathy is difficult to control\\nwith opioids alone, and some patients do better\\nwith gabapentin or antidepressants instead of,\\nor in addition to, an increased methadone\\ndosage or the addition of another opioid for\\nbreakthrough pain (see ìPain Managementî\\nbelow). Patients with AIDS-related dementia or\\nloss of balance may become erratic and difficult\\nto monitor in an OTP . For them, a referral for\\nneuropsychological evaluation may be helpful\\nto identify any cognitive deficits and effective\\nways to provide supportive care. As dementia\\nworsens, patients with take-home privileges\\nmay lose methadone bottles or mistakenly take\\nmore than one daily dose. Patients who fall or\\nare unsteady might be assumed erroneously to\\nbe intoxicated. Close cooperation between OTP\\nstaff and providers treating these patients for\\nAIDS is key to managing patients with neuro-\\nlogic complications of AIDS.\\nReferral for treatment\\nMost OTPs offer no onsite treatment for HIV\\nbecause of its complexity and their limited\\nresources.

Medical treatment providers, accred-\\niting bodies, and the popular press have\\nfocused considerable attention on the need for\\nadequate pain treatment, particularly to relieve\\nchronic, nonmalignant pain or pain at the end\\nof life, including palliative care with large doses\\nof opioids. Pain in MAT patients can sometimes\\nbe managed with nonopioid medications, as\\nwell as nonpharmacologic approaches, but\\noften the pain is severe and refractory to \\nnonopioid analgesics or nonpharmacologic\\ntreatments.\\nIncreased attention to pain control has made\\neven physicians who are not addiction \\nspecialists more familiar with the use of\\nmethadone in pain treatment, and they also \\nare more likely to understand that methadone\\nshould be continued if patients receiving MAT\\nare hospitalized. Reluctance to provide ade-\\nquate pain treatment to patients in MAT \\nusually is based on the mistaken belief that a\\nmaintenance dose of opioid addiction treatment\\nmedication also relieves acute pain. In fact,\\nlong-term opioid pharmacotherapy produces\\nsubstantial tolerance for the analgesic effects \\nof opioid treatment medications; therefore, a\\nusual maintenance dose affords little or no \\npain relief.\\nPatients receiving methadone maintenance\\ntreatment were shown to be hyperalgesic,\\nmeaning that they experienced pain more\\nseverely than those not receiving methadone\\n(Doverty et al. 2001b). Patients in methadone\\nmaintenance also were shown to have high \\nlevels of tolerance for the analgesic effects of\\nopioids, suggesting that conventional doses of\\nmorphine may be ineffective in managing\\nepisodes of acute pain in this patient group\\n(Doverty et al. 2001a).\\nAnother common concern is that opioid-\\ncontaining analgesics aggravate addiction \\ndisorders. In fact, relapse to illicit opioid use\\nhas occurred when opioid analgesics are given\\nto people in recovery. Such patients generally\\nshould not be given the drugs they abused \\npreviously, and patients with current or past\\nopioid addiction should be monitored more\\nclosely than those without these problems.\\nRelapse occurs most often when practitioners\\nare unaware of their patientsí opioid \\naddiction history.\\nOccasionally some patients do not meet\\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\\nDisorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision\\n(DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric\\nAssociation 2000), criteria for addiction, but\\nthey believe they are addicted to pain medica-\\ntion because they are dependent physically as a\\nresult of chronic use of these medications.

Disadvantages\\nof this approach are that regulations and\\nrequirements for observed dosing may be oner-\\nous and that these patients receive treatment\\nwhere most patients are opioid addicted, which\\nmight not be therapeutic for patients not\\naddicted in the usual sense. If these patients\\nare treated in OTPs, the new regulatory frame-\\nwork allows for up to 1 month of take-home\\nmedication, provided evidence of stability and\\nabsence of unprescribed drug use exist (see\\nchapter 5). This option could reduce markedly\\nthe burdens imposed by the earlier, more rigid\\nregulatory framework of OTPs. In smaller\\ncommunities with no OTPs, such patients might\\nbe ostracized from pharmacies or from primary\\ncare offices for insisting on proper pain con-\\ntrol.

Some\\nphysicians are willing to accept patients after\\nthey have been stabilized by the OTP .\\nTypes of Pain\\nExamples of conditions, either foreseeable or\\nunplanned, that produce acute pain include\\ntraumatic injury, dental procedures, and labor\\nand delivery. A dying patient with lung cancer\\nprobably has chronic malignant pain. Patients\\nwith arthritis or disc disease might have chronic\\nnonmalignant pain. In addition, patients in\\nMAT might have withdrawal-related pain, \\nusually as aches in bones and joints along with\\nother withdrawal signs and symptoms. Various\\ntypes of pain are not mutually exclusive. For\\nexample, withdrawal, anxiety, and depression\\nmake chronic pain worse, and patients with\\nchronic pain may have acute exacerbations of\\ntheir pain. The most therapeutic intervention\\nfor pain depends on its type, community\\nresources, patient preferences, and the extent\\nof services available.\\nAcute pain\\nPatients occasionally require medical, surgical,\\nand dental procedures that must be performed\\naway from the OTP . In their guidelines for\\ntreating pain in patients receiving methadone,\\nScimeca and colleagues noted that these\\npatients often required large doses of opioids at\\nrelatively short intervals for pain control\\nbecause they had developed tolerance for \\nopioids. One recommended approach to pain\\nmanagement for this group was to prescribe\\nadequate doses of an alternative mu opioid \\nagonist, such as morphine, hydromorphone, or\\noxycodone, while maintaining the maintenance\\ndose of methadone or LAAM (Scimeca et al.\\n2000). Partial agonists such as buprenorphine,\\nbutorphanol tartrate, and nalbuphine should\\nbe avoided because they can cause opioid with-\\ndrawal in patients receiving MAT (Rao and\\nSchottenfeld 1999). Whenever possible, pain\\nmanagement should be discussed with care\\nproviders before surgery or dental procedures.\\nSeveral principles provide the basis for manag-\\ning acute pain in hospitalized patients also\\nreceiving opioid addiction pharmacotherapy\\n(Compton and McCaffery 1999; Savage 1998;\\nScimeca et al. 2000):\\nï Methadone should be continued at the same\\ndaily dose, whether by oral or intramuscular\\nroutes, although it can be divided. For exam-\\nple, 50 percent of the usual dose can be given\\nbefore surgery and 50 percent after. If\\nmethadone must be given parenterally, the\\ninjected dose should be 50 percent of the \\noral dose, because it is absorbed twice as \\nefficiently by injection.\\nï LAAM patients can be treated temporarily\\nwith equivalent daily methadone doses (usu-\\nally the 48-hour LAAM dose divided by 1.2),\\ntaking into account the timing of the last\\nLAAM dose and its longer acting effects. \\nï Buprenorphine treatment may have to \\nbe suspended temporarily because it can\\nattenuate or block the effects of opioids.\\nï Hospital physicians should be aware that\\nmethadone can be prescribed by any physi-\\ncian with a DEA registration for treating'),\n",

The effects of concomitant alcohol and\\nmethadone, levo-alpha acetyl methadol (LAAM),\\nor buprenorphine use are additive and more\\nsedating than either alcohol or treatment medi-\\ncation alone. Alcohol abuse can aggravate liver\\ndamage from hepatitis C, which is common\\namong patients in MAT. Alcohol-related factors\\nare a major cause of death among patients in\\nMAT, both during and after treatment, and of\\nadministrative discharges from OTPs (Appel et\\nal. 2000). On average, patients in MAT who are\\nalcohol dependent have more medical and men-\\ntal disorders, greater criminality, and poorer\\nsocial and family functioning and peer relations\\nthan patients who are not alcohol dependent\\n(Chatham et al. 1995b).\\nAlcohol abuse among patients in MAT can\\naffect treatment compliance (Bickel and Amass\\n1993) and outcomes adversely. Continuous use\\nmay induce enzyme activity that increases the\\nmetabolism of treatment medication, reducing\\nmedication plasma levels and resulting in symp-\\ntoms of undermedication that further compli-\\ncate treatment.\\nResearch is limited or conflicting on alcohol\\ndisorder treatment for patients in MAT. Many\\nstudies comparing alcohol use before OTP\\nadmission and after 1 year have found little or\\nno improvement (e.g., Fairbank et al. 1993;\\nHubbard et al. 1997). However, one study\\nfound that short-term MAT reduced alcohol\\nconsumption significantly in patients who did\\nnot meet alcohol-dependence criteria (Caputo\\net al. 2002), and a 10-year study found that less\\nthan 6 percent of patients in MAT reported\\nalcohol problems in the previous 6 months\\n(Appel et al. 2001). \\nLubrano and colleagues (2002) found an associ-\\nation between inadequate methadone doses and\\nincreased cravings for both heroin and alcohol.\\nOthers noted that continued alcohol consump-\\ntion among patients dependent on alcohol was\\nassociated with smaller increases in methadone\\ndoses during MAT (El-Bassel et al. 1993).\\nStastny and Potter (1991) found that many\\npatients in MAT who abused alcohol also\\nabused benzodiazepines.\\nTreatment for alcohol dependence involves a\\ncomprehensive approach combining detoxifica-\\ntion if needed, counseling, medications such as\\ndisulfiram, and participation in mutual-help\\ngroups (Fuller and Hiller-Sturmhofel 1999).\\nMany groups do not support use of mainte-\\nnance medication. Other interventions have\\nmet with limited success. A pilot study provid-\\ned intensive education for staff members at\\nOTPs in which 220 patients receiving\\nmethadone also were treated for alcohol depen-\\ndence. Eighty percent of these patients com-\\nplied with treatment requirements and com-\\npleted treatment (Kipnis et al. 2001). \\nBenzodiazepines\\nBenzodiazepines such as diazepam (ValiumÆ)\\nand clonazepam (KlonopinÆ) have antianxiety\\nand sedative effects. They are schedule IV\\ndrugs, signifying relatively low abuse liability.\\nHowever, people with other addiction disorders\\nare more likely to abuse benzodiazepines than\\nare members of the general population (Ross\\nand Darke 2000). In an early study, patients\\nreceiving opioid treatment medication who also\\nabused benzodiazepines typically took the lat-\\nter within 1 hour of the former and reported\\nthat benzodiazepines increased the effects of\\nthe medication (Stitzer et al. 1981). These\\neffects likely result from an interaction in\\nwhich each drug potentiates the sedative\\naspects of the otheróknown on the street as\\nìboosting.î When used in prescribed doses,\\nbenzodiazepines are not dangerous for patients\\nin MAT, except when they cause patients to\\nseek other drugs with sedative effects. High-\\ndose benzodiazepines can cause serious prob-\\nlems, including severe intoxication and higher\\nrisk of injuries or fatal overdoses. These risks\\nare potentiated when high doses of benzodi-\\nazepines are mixed with methadone or other\\ndrugs that produce sedation and respiratory\\ndepression, even among patients in MAT who\\nhave developed tolerance for the respiratory-\\ndepressant effects of opioids.\\nIn the experience of the consensus panel,\\npatient use of benzodiazepines negatively\\naffects attendance at treatment sessions and\\n183Treatment of Multiple Substance Use'),\n",

Regular benzodiazepine use\\nfor 3 months or more may be associated with\\nphysiologic dependence, even when benzodi-\\nazepines are taken in prescribed doses.\\nPatients who are abusing or dependent on ben-\\nzodiazepines usually need detoxification and\\nmore intensive treatment interventions to\\nremain safely in MAT.\\nNonbenzodiazepine Sedatives\\nNonbenzodiazepine sedatives such as interme-\\ndiate- or short-acting barbiturates or\\nglutethimide are more likely than benzodi-\\nazepines to produce lethal overdose because\\npeople who abuse them develop tolerance for\\ntheir sedative and euphoric effects but not for\\ntheir respiratory-depressant effects. Therefore,\\nas these people increase their dosages to get\\nhigh, they suddenly can overdose to respirato-\\nry depression. People who are opioid addicted\\nand abuse nonbenzodiazepine sedatives usually\\nneed inpatient detoxification before starting\\nMAT or may do better with referral to a long-\\nterm, residential program such as a therapeutic\\ncommunity. Nonbenzodiazepine sedatives\\ninduce cytochrome P450 3A, an enzyme\\ninvolved in methadone, LAAM, and buprenor-\\nphine metabolism (see chapter 3), and can\\nmake stabilization difficult.\\nThe consensus panel recommends that OTPs\\nwithhold treatment medication for patients who\\nappear intoxicated with a sedative-type drug\\nuntil intoxication has cleared and patients are\\neither detoxified from sedatives or confirmed\\nnot to be sedative dependent. Nonbenzo-\\ndiazepine sedative and barbiturate abuse is\\nrare in most areas. These medications are less\\nwidely abused than in the past, because benzo-\\ndiazepines are less dangerous and easier to\\nobtain in many areas.\\nCocaine and Other Stimulants\\nStimulant abuse, especially cocaine, is another\\nserious problem in many OTPs (see Exhibit \\n11-1). Adverse effects of these substances\\ninclude cardiovascular effects (hypertension,\\nstroke, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction), \\nrespiratory effects (perforation of nasal septum,\\nbronchial irritation) if inhaled or smoked, or\\nmental effects (anxiety, depression, anger,\\nparanoia, psychotic symptoms). Patients in\\nMAT who abuse stimulants may be disruptive \\nif the stimulants have severe mental effects,\\nand these patients may have problems with\\nmood swings and compliance with group or\\nindividual therapy. TIP 33, Treatment for\\nStimulant Use Disorders(CSAT 1999c), \\nprovides more information.\\nAnother concern for patients in MAT who use\\ncocaine is concurrent alcohol use. The combi-\\nnation of alcohol and cocaine is popular\\nbecause it can create a more intense high and\\nless intense feelings of inebriation than either\\nsubstance alone. Individuals also use alcohol to\\ntemper discomfort when they come down from\\na cocaine-induced high. Patients in MAT who\\nabuse both alcohol and cocaine are significantly\\nmore difficult to engage and retain in treatment\\nthan patients who do not abuse all three sub-\\nstances (Rowan-Szal et al. 2000b). In addition,\\ncocaethylene, a psychoactive derivative of\\ncocaine formed exclusively during the combined\\nadministration of cocaine and alcohol, can\\nincrease the cardiotoxic effects of either sub-\\nstance alone. The combination of alcohol and\\ncocaine tends to have exponential effects on\\nheart rate and may increase violent thoughts\\nand tendencies (Pennings et al. 2002). The mix-\\nture of opioids, cocaine, and alcohol can be\\nlethal and has been identified as a leading cause\\nof accidental overdose (Coffin et al. 2003). \\nTennant and Shannon (1995) found that\\ncocaine use appeared to lower the methadone\\nconcentration in blood. In addition, some\\npatients reduced their cocaine use when their\\nmethadone dosages were increased. Borg and\\ncolleagues (1999) found that adequate doses of\\nmethadone seemed to reduce cocaine use even\\nthough methadone does not target cocaine\\ndirectly. More focused treatments and research\\non these interactions are needed.\\nTraditionally, disulfiram has been used to treat\\nalcohol dependence (chapter 3). Because\\ncocaine often is used with alcohol, Petrakis and\\n184 Chapter 11'),\n",

Patients\\nwho were treated with disulfiram significantly\\ndecreased the quantity and frequency of their\\ncocaine use, whereas those treated with a\\nplacebo did not. Related studies found that the\\npositive effects of disulfiram on cocaine use\\namong patients in substance abuse treatment\\nremained evident after 1 year (Carroll et al.\\n2000) and that disulfiram also was promising\\nfor patients treated with buprenorphine\\n(George et al. 2000). More research on the \\nbenefits of disulfiram therapy for cocaine\\ndependence during MAT is needed.\\nMarijuana \\nIn general, THC use is not as prevalent as\\ncocaine or amphetamine use among patients \\nin MAT (see Exhibit 11-2). Some studies have\\nconcluded that THC use in MAT does not \\naffect MAT outcomes adversely. For example,\\nEpstein and Preston (2003) found that THC\\nwas not associated with either poor treatment\\nretention or problem use of other substances\\nsuch as cocaine. One study (Wasserman et al.\\n1998) showed that, for patients committed to\\nopioid abstinence and doing well, positive tests\\nfor THC could predict relapse, but this finding\\nhas not been replicated (Epstein and Preston\\n2003).\\nOTPs vary in whether they require THC-free\\ndrug tests before patients can qualify for or\\ncontinue take-home medication privileges. The\\nconsensus panel recommends that OTPs\\naddress patient THC use because, as with other\\nsubstances of abuse, THC increases the proba-\\nbility that patients will engage in activities that\\nput them at higher risk of relapse to opioid use,\\nother health problems, other related illicit\\nactivities, and legal problems.\\nPatients in MAT sometimes use THC to self-\\nmedicate for anxiety or insomnia. Approaches\\nto address THC use in these patients include\\nincreased counseling, treatment of their anxiety\\ndisorders with standard psychotropic medica-\\ntions and psychotherapy, and requirements\\nthat drug tests be free of THC before patients\\ncan qualify for take-home medication. Unlike\\npeople addicted to nonopioid substances,\\npatients in MAT who are opioid addicted rarely\\nseek treatment for THC dependence. There-\\nfore, it has received less attention in OTPs than\\nin other substance abuse treatment programs.\\nNicotine\\nTobaccoñsmoking-related illnesses are a major\\ncause of morbidity and mortality among\\npatients in MAT as they are in the general \\npopulation. For example, 40 percent of deaths\\nover 15 years in one physicianís office-based\\nMAT program were related to cigarette smoking,\\nwhich was more than deaths from HIV/AIDS,\\nhepatitis C, and violence combined (Salsitz et\\nal. 2000).

Research has shown that smoking\\ninterventions neither detract from nor interfere\\nwith addiction recovery and that patients who\\nattempt nicotine cessation are at the same risk\\nfor relapse as other patients (Ellingstad et al.\\n1999; Hughes 1995).

In addition, some State regulations set\\nspecific timetables for compliance, although the\\nrequirement is unsupported by research. Some\\nOTP staff members may feel that patientsí con-\\ntinued use of alcohol and illicit drugs, despite\\nprogress in recovery from opioid addiction,\\nreflects negatively on OTP credibility and that\\nthese patients are taking the places of people\\nwho would benefit more from MAT. Patients\\nwho continue using illicit drugs sometimes\\nerode the morale of other patients, who may\\nconclude that treatment compliance and absti-\\nnence are optional.\\nPolicies favoring treatment termination for\\npatients who use substances negate a funda-\\nmental principleóthat longer retention in\\ntreatment is correlated highly with increased\\ntreatment success (Hubbard et al. 1997, 2003).\\nIn fact, substantial remission from all sub-\\nstance use is a common and positive outcome of\\nMAT, particularly when treatment includes reg-\\nular drug counseling and other psychosocial\\nservices (McLellan et al. 1993).

Instead of setting\\nstandard timetables for discharge, limits should\\nbe determined on a case-by-case basis.

Because few chronic diseases\\nrespond to a single care model, OTPs need a\\nvariety of techniques for patients who abuse\\nmultiple substances. These techniques should\\nincorporate available medical, mental health,\\nand social services. Usually patients who abuse\\nmultiple substances require a more intensive\\nlevel of care for a limited period. Treatment\\nproviders also should have referral agreements\\nwith inpatient facilities for brief detoxification\\nfrom nonopioid substances, extended stabiliza-\\ntion before reentry into an OTP , or admission\\nto a therapeutic community, residential treat-\\nment, or other long-term, more structured and\\ncontrolled environment. OTPs can enter into\\nagreements with residential treatment pro-\\ngrams to allow continued MAT along with treat-\\nment for other substance dependence.\\nA common problem is that some OTP staff\\nmembers and patients assume that stopping\\nopioid and injection drug use is the sole objec-\\ntive of treatment. Use of cocaine and other sub-\\nstances should cause concern because it under-\\nmines patient stability. Nonetheless, use of\\nsome substances such as THC may be viewed\\nas less serious unless clear evidence exists of\\nimpaired functioning. Many people entering an\\nOTP regard alcohol use as acceptable because\\nit is legal. Changing such attitudes and behav-\\niors requires patience and effort. OTPs should\\nhave clear policies declaring the desirability of\\ncessation of all substance use. These policies\\nshould clarify any ambiguity about abstinence\\nfrom nonprescribed medications but encourage\\ntherapeutic use of medications that are \\neffective to treat legitimate, diagnosed condi-\\ntions. OTPs should encourage abstinence from\\nalcohol and nicotine, but it is difficult to\\nrequire it because these are legal substances.\\nHowever, OTPs may withhold medication if\\npatients have consumed alcohol shortly before\\nor are intoxicated during treatment and should\\naddress alcohol problems.\\nThe consensus panel believes it is helpful, both\\nwhen patients are admitted to an OTP and\\nthroughout treatment, to maintain the position\\nthat opioid use is only the most obvious part of\\npatientsí problems and that the role of all\\nintoxicants (both licit and illicit) in patientsí\\nlives and their overall substance-using lifestyle\\nare other important issues. Patients in MAT\\nshould recognize that use of any intoxicant\\nundermines their progress.\\nDosage Adjustments\\nDuring the dosing period (see chapter 5), OTPs\\nshould ensure that patientsí dosages suppress\\nwithdrawal and produce significant cross-\\ntolerance for opioids of abuse. Patients may be\\nabusing other drugs to self-medicate withdraw-\\nal symptoms caused by inadequate dosages or\\nother factors that affect medication\\nmetabolism. In this case, raising the dosage or\\nsplitting doses may lessen other substance use. \\nIncreased Counseling and\\nOther Psychosocial Services\\nNumerous studies have shown that regular\\ncounseling is associated with a reduction in \\nopioid and other substance use by patients in\\nMAT (Villano et al. 2002; see chapter 8 in this\\nTIP).

Certain mental disorders (e.g.,\\nantisocial personality disorder [APD],\\nschizophrenia) and some affective and anxiety\\ndisorders (phobias, bipolar depression) have\\nbeen found to be more prevalent among per-\\nsons with substance use disorders than in the\\ngeneral population (Regier et al. 1990).\\nHowever, some of these studies did not \\ndetermine whether symptoms of co-occurring\\ndisorders were related to the pharmacological\\neffects of substances or to an underlying \\nnonñsubstance-related disorder.

Early studies found that the severity\\nof co-occurring disorder symptoms, particular-\\nly in patients with anxiety or depression,\\nstrongly predicted treatment outcomes and that\\nthe most severely symptomatic patients had the\\nheaviest substance use and most impaired\\nadjustment, whereas the least symptomatic did\\nbest in addiction treatment (McLellan et al.\\n1993; Rounsaville et al. 1986). However, later\\nstudies have found that higher symptom severi-\\nty, although associated with higher levels of\\nsubstance use and worse overall adjustment,\\ndid not predict treatment response.

Such\\nmedications may facilitate engagement in MAT\\nand addiction recovery (Minkoff 2000).\\nPatients with less severe, pre-\\nsumptively substance-induced\\nco-occurring disorders\\nThe consensus panel recommends that patients\\nin MAT with symptoms of Axis I disorders but\\nno history of primary co-occurring disorders\\nreceive no new psychotropic medications until\\nthey are stabilized on MAT because their symp-\\ntoms might remit or significantly diminish after\\na period of substance abuse treatment (Joe et\\nal. 1995).

Some antidepressants also\\nhave sedative effects (e.g., mirtazapine\\n[Remeron\\nÆ], trazodone, and some tricyclic\\nantidepressants), which might be beneficial for\\npatients with insomnia when these drugs are\\ntaken before bedtime, or for patients with high\\nlevels of anxiety. Nonsedating antidepressants\\nmight be especially useful for patients with \\npsychomotor inhibition.\\nThe well-documented abuse potential of \\nbenzodiazepines has led to a common belief\\nthat they are contraindicated in patients \\nreceiving methadone. However, evidence sug-\\ngests major differences in the abuse liability of\\nbenzodiazepines.

Sellers and colleagues also found a\\nìserious pattern of nontherapeutic benzodi-\\nazepine use . . . among opiate-dependent \\npersons, particularly those in methadone main-\\ntenance treatment programsî (1993, p. 72),\\nleading these authors to recommend that ìif\\nbenzodiazepine is used [with this group], those\\nwith an apparently low abuse potential are \\ngenerally preferable.î\\nThe consensus panel believes that patients who\\nhave a history of benzodiazepine abuse should\\nnot be disallowed from receiving previously\\nprescribed benzodiazepines, provided that they\\nare monitored carefully and have stopped the\\nearlier abuse. They may be attempting to\\nreduce symptoms of co-occurring disorders,\\nand, when they receive a prescribed medication\\nwith low abuse liability and are monitored for\\ntheir co-occurring anxiety and substance use\\ndisorders, improvement and cessation of other\\nbenzodiazepine use may occur naturally.

In\\n1998, a National Institutes of Health consensus panel recommended\\nmethadone maintenance as the standard of care for pregnant women\\nwith opioid addiction (National Institutes of Health Consensus\\nDevelopment Panel 1998). Methadone currently is the only opioid medi-\\ncation approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for\\nmedication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction (MAT) in pregnant\\npatients. Buprenorphine is classified as a category C drug by FDA (i.e.,\\none lacking adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women) and, at\\nthis writing, is not FDA approved to treat pregnant women, although\\nseveral studies have found it safe and effective in this group (e.g.,\\nFischer et al. 2000; Lacroix et al. 2004). Even though it is a category C\\ndrug, buprenorphine may be used with pregnant patients in the United\\nStates under certain circumstances (see ìUse of Buprenorphine During\\nPregnancyî later in this chapter).\\nEffective medical maintenance treatment with methadone has the same\\nbenefits for pregnant patients as for patients in general.

They\\nmight have been sexually active for years \\nwithout using contraceptives and becoming\\npregnant. The consensus panel has noted that,\\nbecause methadone normalizes endocrine func-\\ntions, it is not unusual for women in the early\\nphases of MAT to become pregnant uninten-\\ntionally, especially if they receive no counseling\\nfor this possibility.\\nProcedures for diagnosing opioid and other\\naddictions in pregnant women should incorpo-\\nrate information from their medical and sub-\\nstance use histories, physical examinations, drug\\ntest reports, and observed signs or symptoms of\\nwithdrawal. Other indications of addiction may\\ninclude evidence of diseases associated with\\ndrug use (e.g., hepatitis, bacterial endocarditis,\\ncellulitis), poor attendance for prenatal care,\\nand unexplained fetal growth abnormalities\\n(e.g., intrauterine growth retardation). Using an\\nopioid antagonist to diagnose addiction in preg-\\nnant women is absolutely contraindicated\\n(Finnegan 1991); inducing even mild withdrawal\\ncan cause premature labor or other adverse\\nfetal effects.\\nMedical and\\nObstetrical Concerns\\nand Complications\\nPregnant women who abuse substances, \\nincluding alcohol and nicotine, have a greater-\\nthan-normal risk of medical complications.\\nThese women should be monitored regularly\\nfor signs of anemia, poor nutrition, increased\\nblood pressure, hyperglycemia, sexually trans-\\nmitted diseases (STDs), hepatitis, preeclampsia,\\nand other complications of pregnancy or health\\nproblems related to addiction. Good nutrition,\\nincluding vitamin supplements, should be\\nencouraged. Pregnant women should be edu-\\ncated about the potential adverse effects of \\nsubstance use on their fetuses, such as fetal\\nalcohol syndrome and premature labor associ-\\nated with opioid withdrawal or stimulant use.\\nPatient use of prescribed medications other than\\nmethadone should be monitored for compliance\\nwith usage directions and for adverse effects.\\nChronic substance use in pregnancy can cause\\nmedical complications (some are listed in\\nExhibit 13-1), depending on how substances are\\nadministered and when or whether problems\\nare identified and treated. Infections account\\nfor a high percentage of these complications in\\npregnant women who are opioid addicted, as\\nthey do in all people who abuse opioids (see\\nchapter 10). Infections can be profoundly\\nharmful to both women and their fetuses, par-\\nticularly if infections remain unrecognized and\\nuntreated during gestation.

For exam-\\nple, patients already maintained and stable on\\nbuprenorphine who become pregnant probably\\nshould continue on buprenorphine with careful\\nmonitoring. Pregnant women who are opioid\\naddicted but cannot tolerate methadone, those\\nfor whom program compliance has been diffi-\\ncult, or those who are adamant about avoiding\\nmethadone may be good candidates for\\nbuprenorphine. In such circumstances, it\\nshould be clearly documented in the patientís\\nmedical record that she has refused methadone\\nmaintenance treatment or that such services\\nare unavailable; that she was informed of the\\nrisks of using buprenorphine, a medication\\nthat has not been thoroughly studied in preg-\\nnancy; and that she understands these risks.\\nWhen treating pregnant patients, treatment\\nproviders should use buprenorphine monother-\\napy tablets (Subutex\\nÆ) because no work has\\nbeen done on the effects of fetal exposure to\\nsublingual naloxone in buprenorphine-\\nnaloxone combination tablets (Suboxone\\nÆ) \\nduring pregnancy. Consensus panelists have\\nfound that a patient already maintained on\\nbuprenorphine-naloxone combination tablets\\nwho becomes pregnant can be transferred\\ndirectly to buprenorphine monotherapy tablets.\\nA more detailed discussion on buprenorphine\\nuse in the treatment and management of \\npregnant patients and its effects in newborns\\ncan be found in TIP 40, Clinical Guidelines \\nfor the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment\\nof Opioid Addiction (CSAT 2004a). For a com-\\nprehensive review of buprenorphine use in\\npregnant patients and its effects on the\\nneonate, see the article by Johnson and col-\\nleagues (2003a). Current data indicate that\\nbuprenorphine probably is safe and effective\\nfor some women who are pregnant and opioid\\naddicted, but more research is needed.\\nBuprenorphine Effects on NAS\\nJohnson and colleagues (2003a) reviewed 21\\nreports of buprenorphine use during pregnan-\\ncy, most from Europe, and found that NAS was\\nreported in 62 percent of approximately 309\\ninfants exposed to buprenorphine, with 48 \\npercent requiring treatment and 40 percent\\nconfounded by other drug use. Another study\\nof 100 infants of mothers maintained on\\nbuprenorphine found NAS in approximately 67\\npercent (Johnson et al. 2001). Of these, 53 per-\\ncent required treatment for withdrawal, and\\napproximately 7 percent were admitted to a\\nneonatal intensive care unit. Similar to infants\\nborn to women receiving methadone, infants of\\nwomen receiving comprehensive prenatal care\\nplus buprenorphine had improved birth out-\\ncomes compared with those whose mothers\\nreceived no comprehensive prenatal care.\\nBuprenorphine-associated NAS generally\\nappears within 12 to 48 hours, peaks at 72 to\\n96 hours, and lasts 120 to 168 hours, although\\nsome reports have indicated buprenorphine-\\nrelated NAS lasting 6 to 10 weeks.\\nBuprenorphine-associated NAS was found to\\nbe less intense than that associated with\\nmethadone (Johnson et al. 2003a). If controlled\\nrandomized trials confirm that newborns of\\nmothers treated with buprenorphine have less\\nNAS than those of mothers treated with\\nmethadone, it may be appropriate to switch\\npatients from methadone to buprenorphine\\nduring early pregnancy to reduce chances for\\nmarked withdrawal syndromes in newborns.\\n221MAT During Pregnancy'),\n",

Administrators\\nshould seek staff members who are free of rigid\\nbiases, are not judgmental, and do not have\\npunitive attitudes toward patients (Bell 2000). \\nOTP staff members sometimes hold negative\\nattitudes toward patients (Caplehorn et al.\\n1997) or MAT (Forman et al. 2001). At least\\none study has associated such attitudes with\\nlower rates of patient retention and poorer\\npatient outcomes (Caplehorn et al. 1998). OTP\\nmanagers should be vigilant about monitoring\\nstaff attitudes and conduct inservice training to\\ncreate or sustain appropriate attitudes about\\npatients and MAT.\\nThe verbal expressions used by OTP staff\\nmembers can reflect how they feel toward\\npatients. Treatment staff members, who might\\nhave absorbed societyís antipathy toward \\npeople in MAT, sometimes use counterthera-\\npeutic language, for example, the phrase ìdirty\\nurineî to describe an unsatisfactory urine drug\\ntest (ìpositive testî is less judgmental). Staff\\nshould avoid terms suggesting the criminal \\njustice system, such as ìprobationî or ìproba-\\ntionary,î to refer to the status of patients doing\\npoorly in treatment. ìTerminationî should be\\navoided in reference to patient discharge.\\nOther preferred expressions in MAT include\\nìpatientsî not ìclientsî and ìdose taperingî or\\nìmedically supervised withdrawalî not ìdetoxî\\nin reference to withdrawal from treatment\\nmedication. Applying words derived from\\nìtoxinî to treatment medication suggests that\\nthe medication is a toxin; ìdetoxificationî\\nshould refer only to withdrawal from substances\\nof abuse.\\nInclusion of recovering patients.The consen-\\nsus panel believes that employing treatment\\nprofessionals and support staff who are in\\nrecovery also adds valuable perspectives to\\ntreatment and provides role models for\\npatients. OTP policies on hiring people who are\\nin addiction recovery should be in writing and\\ninclude procedures for addressing staff mem-\\nbers who relapse. State regulations may estab-\\nlish a minimum abstinence period before an\\nOTP can hire someone in recovery.

The consensus panel believes\\nthat this resistance has been reduced since TIP\\n1, State Methadone Treatment Guidelines\\n(CSAT 1993b), was published, particularly\\nthrough efforts to improve scientific clarity\\nabout opioid addiction, to affirm the efficacy\\nand benefits of MAT, and to educate profes-\\nsionals and the public about MAT. The expand-\\ning patient advocacy movement effectively may\\nbe countering some stereotypes and misunder-\\nstandings about MAT. Some treatment\\nproviders have overcome community opposi-\\ntionósometimes called not-in-my-backyard\\n(NIMBY) syndromeóthrough outreach and\\neducational efforts (e.g., Weber and Cowie\\n1995). Many prevention and treatment pro-\\ngrams are becoming increasingly responsive to\\nthe needs of cultural and ethnic groups (i.e.,\\nmore culturally competent). These successes\\nprovide models for effective community \\nrelations in other settings.\\nDespite progress, MAT remains stigmatized and\\ncontroversial in many U.S. communities\\n(Joseph et al. 2000). The association of MAT\\nwith substantial improvements in individual\\nhealth and employment and with reductions in\\nHIV risk and criminal behavior has been vali-\\ndated by research (e.g., Krantz and Mehler\\n2004; Mueller and Wyman 1997), but MAT\\nremains misunderstood even among some\\nhealth care professionals.\\nSensationalized media coverage and successful\\nNIMBY-type opposition have continued to\\ndelay or preempt the siting of new facilities\\n(Lawmakers may restrict 2000; Shepard 2001;\\nSissenwein 2000; Zoning fight over Michigan\\n1998). Introducing MAT into communities is\\ndifficult without community support. However,\\nthe consensus panel believes that, since the\\nearly 1990s, the willingness of treatment profes-\\nsionals and patients; government officials;\\nagencies representing health, mental health,\\naddiction treatment, research, and criminal\\njustice; and the general public to learn more\\nabout MAT and opioid addiction has increased.\\nOrganizations appear more willing to include\\nOTPs in community health planning as well-\\nregarded community services, but this effort\\nremains a work in progress.\\nGood Community Relations\\nGood community relations are part of good\\ntreatment.

These\\nconnections increase the need for effective out-\\nreach to other community services and entities.\\nOvercoming Negative\\nCommunity Reactions to OTPs\\nJoseph and colleagues (2000) reported that\\nmost community resistance involves concern\\nabout patient loitering, drug sales, and the\\ndiversion of methadone (see ìMedication\\nDiversion Control Plansî above). Adding \\nalternative care models and longer acting \\npharmacotherapies to the services continuum\\ncan decrease loitering, illicit transactions, ille-\\ngal parking, and other activities that increase\\ncommunity concerns. These options enable\\nhighly functioning patients who meet specific\\ncriteria to receive ongoing medical care and\\npharmacotherapy with fewer visits to the OTP .\\nIn the view of the consensus panel, incorpora-\\ntion of primary medical care, day treatment,\\nand short-stay residential models into \\ntreatment options can affect community \\nperceptions positively because patients\\ninvolved in MAT are less likely to loiter near\\nthe OTP .\\nFacilities for onsite patient activities to limit\\noutside loitering are beneficial. Having ade-\\nquate onsite staff is equally important in avoid-\\ning and resolving community problems. Glezen\\nand Lowery (1999) provide other practical\\nguidelines for addressing community concerns\\nabout substance abuse treatment facilities.\\nCommunity opposition can be triggered when\\ncommunity groups believe that they have been\\ninformed or consulted insufficiently. OTP\\nadministrators should meet regularly with \\ncommunity leaders to ensure that all parties\\nare heard. The physical appearance of facilities\\nshould be conceived carefully. The OTP should\\nbe clean and orderly to distinguish it as a pro-\\nfessional, responsible facility. Surrounding\\nproperty (e.g., entrances, sidewalks, fencing,\\ntrash receptacles, signs) and OTP hours should\\nnot impede pedestrian or vehicle traffic. The\\navailability of public transportation is impor-\\ntant when considering an OTPís location\\n(Glezen and Lowery 1999).\\nSome communities have found mobile treat-\\nment facilities more acceptable than fixed-site\\nOTPs. Mobile services allow more people\\naddicted to opioids to be treated without con-\\nfronting NIMBY reactions. Pilot studies have\\nconfirmed their success (e.g., Gleghorn 2002;\\nHo 1999). \\nWhether institution or community based, fixed\\nsite or mobile, OTPs should be situated,\\ndesigned, and operated in accordance with\\naccreditation standards, Federal guidelines,\\nand State and local licensing, approval, and\\noperating requirements. The consensus panel\\nrecommends that MAT providers thoroughly\\nknow and understand their communities and\\nprovide the levels of input and support\\nrequested by community leaders, representa-\\ntives, and constituents to site a facility and\\ndevelop services that are responsive to \\ncommunity needs.\\n232 Chapter 14'),\n",

Previous regulations\\n(21 CFR, Part 291), which gave regulatory\\noversight to FDA, stressed process evaluation\\nbased on compliance with recommended \\ntreatment procedures. Process evaluation does\\nnot ask whether a recommended process has\\nworked, only whether it has been followed.\\nThe Institute of Medicine (IOM) was among the\\nfirst organizations to recommend an outcome\\nevaluation system for OTPs based on ìdirect\\nand valid measures of reduction in opiate and\\nnon-opiate drug use and improvement in posi-\\ntive social functionî (Institute of Medicine\\n1995, p. 228), which could be used by OTPs,\\nregulatory and funding agencies, and\\nresearchers.

Eight States participated\\nin the MTQAS study, but only Massachusetts\\nand North Carolina are using elements of the\\nsystem at this writing.

It should focus on progress\\nmarkers (see chapter 7) and behavioral\\nimprovements as guideposts and avoid terms\\nsuch as ìsuccessî and ìfailure.î Even small\\nimprovements may be significant. For example,\\nan outcome evaluation might measure drug use\\n(as quantified by drug testing) in patients who\\nhave spent various times in treatment. Such a\\nstudy can set a baseline and provide a bench-\\nmark to evaluate the effects of changes in pro-\\ngram practices, for example, prescribing indi-\\nvidually appropriate dosages for patients.\\nResearchers measure many variables to assess\\nMAT treatment outcomes, including drug use,\\ncriminal activity, medical problems, vocational\\nskills, employment, family relationships, and\\nsocial activities. The measures selected by an\\nOTP should agree with the target behaviors\\nspecified in program goals and objectives. For\\nexample, evaluation of a treatment initiative\\ndesigned to reduce substance use, decrease\\ncriminal involvement, and increase job skills\\nshould be based on data in those areas. An\\nOTP can measure other outcomes (such as\\npatientsí use of emergency rooms for medical\\ncare) to assess whether it has had other effects\\non patient behaviors or the community. \\nSAMHSAís accreditation guidelines list the \\nfollowing treatment outcomes as examples of\\nwhat might be measured by OTPs:\\nï ìreducing or eliminating the use of illicit \\nopioids, other illicit-drugs, and the problem-\\natic use of prescription drugs \\nï reducing or eliminating associated criminal\\nactivities\\nï reducing behaviors contributing to the spread\\nof infectious diseases\\nï improving quality of life by restoration of\\nphysical and mental health and functional\\nstatus.î (CSAT 1999b, p. 7)\\nOutcome evaluation also can be focused nar-\\nrowly; it can assess the results of particular\\ntreatment approaches on patient behavior. For\\nexample, an OTP might provide patients with\\nbus tokens to defray transportation costs to\\nand from treatment (some cities fund this kind\\nof intervention). After a certain period, the\\nOTP could evaluate whether providing bus\\ntokens improved program attendance. This\\nsimple evaluation would require only atten-\\ndance data. The most reliable evaluation uses a\\ncontrol group for comparison (e.g., a group of\\npatients who must purchase their bus tokens),\\nbut this is not always practical or ethical.\\nProcess evaluation\\nProcess evaluation describes what is happening\\nin the treatment program: what kind of treat-\\nment, who conducts the sessions, how many\\nand how long the sessions are, and where the\\nsessions occur. A process evaluation documents\\nwhat actually happens during an intervention,\\nhow a new program or initiative is put into\\noperation, who the players are and what steps\\nthey take, specific problems and barriers\\nencountered, strategies used to overcome these\\nproblems and barriers, and necessary modifi-\\ncations to the original plan. Process evaluation\\nalso may describe what is happening within the\\nìblack boxî of the treatment program.

Treatment decisions by MAT\\nproviders should be based on four accepted principles of medical ethics,\\nwhich can be listed briefly as beneficence, autonomy, nonmalfeasance,\\nand justice (Beauchamp and Childress 2001).\\nFundamental Ethical Principles\\nBeneficence (Benefit)\\nAccording to Beauchamp and Childress (2001), the medical principle \\nof beneficence emphasizes that treatment providers should act for the\\nbenefit of patients by providing competent, timely care within the\\nbounds of accepted treatment practice. The principle of beneficence is\\nsatisfied when treatment providers make proper diagnoses and offer \\nevidence-based treatments, that is, treatments drawn from research that\\nprovides statistical data about outcomes or from consensus-based stan-\\ndards of care. Beneficence is compromised when diagnoses are question-\\nable or when outcome data do not validate a diagnosis or treatment.\\nWhen MAT is carried out according to best-practice standards, the \\nprinciple of beneficence is satisfied (Bell and Zador 2000).\\nAutonomy\\nAutonomy, like beneficence, springs from the ideal of promoting\\npatientsí best interests. However, whereas beneficence emphasizes the\\napplication of provider knowledge and skills to improve patient health,\\nautonomy emphasizes respect for patientsí rights to decide what treat-\\nment is in their best interests (Beauchamp and Childress 2001).\\nStandard medical practice places great value on patient autonomy.\\nUsually, patientsí and physiciansí goals for treatment are identical, but,\\nwhen they differ, physicians generally accord patients the right to make\\n297'),\n",

Normally, standard medical prac-\\ntice does not permit an exception when patients\\nmake the ìwrongî choice and the physician\\nìknows better.î The physician may educate or\\nperhaps attempt to persuade a patient but may\\nnot make decisions for the patient.\\nNonmalfeasanceóìFirst, Do\\nNo Harm î\\nThe principle of nonmalfeasance emphasizes\\nthat health care providers should not harm or\\ninjure patients (Beauchamp and Childress\\n2001). Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) are\\non strong footing in terms of this principle.\\nBefore entering MAT, patients have been\\ningesting illicit opioids (and often other sub-\\nstances) and exposing themselves to serious\\nhealth risks. Patients entering MAT are also at\\nrisk of arrest and imprisonment for illegal\\nactivities to support their addictions.\\nOnce enrolled in OTPs, patients begin ingesting\\nmedications that have been manufactured in a\\nregulated setting. The risks associated with\\ninjecting or otherwise ingesting substances of\\nabuse produced under unknown conditions are\\ngradually eliminated. Patients come under the\\ncare of professionals who monitor adverse drug\\nreactions and attend to other health care needs.\\nHowever, MAT carries risks of its own, includ-\\ning an increased risk of death in the induction\\nphase of pharmacotherapy if medication dosage\\nis not adjusted carefully (see chapter 5).\\nJustice\\nThe principle of justice emphasizes that treat-\\nment providers should act with fairness\\n(Beauchamp and Childress 2001). Sometimes\\nthis principle is expressed as the duty of\\nproviders to treat patients in similar circum-\\nstances equally and to use resources equitably.\\nWhen treatment resources are limited, it may\\nbe unclear how to apply this principle in MAT.\\nThe principle of justice also applies when treat-\\nment providers consider the involuntary dis-\\ncharge of patients.\\nBesides emphasizing that clinicians should act\\nfairly toward patients, the principle of justice\\nimposes a responsibility to advocate politically\\nand socially for resources (including adequate\\nfunding and better treatment by other medical\\nproviders) to meet the needs of patients in MAT.\\nEthics in Practice\\nConflict Between Beneficence\\nand Autonomy\\nA conflict arises between the principles of\\nbeneficence and autonomy when a treatment\\nprovider and a patient disagree about what is\\nin the patientís best interest and how treatment\\nshould progress.

Involuntary discharge\\nappears to breach practitionersí duties to put\\npatient health first, do no harm, and respect\\npatientsí wishes, as well as to avoid harm to the\\ncommunity from reintroducing the effects of\\nuntreated opioid use (especially criminal\\nbehavior and potential disease transmission).\\nYet an OTP often must balance the interests of\\nindividuals facing discharge with those of other\\npatients, staff, future patients, and the larger\\ncommunity and society.\\nThreats to safety\\nWhen a patient commits or threatens an act of\\nviolence against another patient (on OTP\\npremises) or against staff (on or off OTP\\npremises), comes to treatment armed with a\\nweapon, or deals drugs at or near an OTP , that\\npatient poses a threat to the safety of the pro-\\ngram, its staff, and its patients. Involuntary\\ndischarge of such a patient, although not in his\\nor her best interests, takes into account the\\nOTPís ethical responsibility to the rest of its\\npatients (current and future), its staff, and oth-\\ners. The consensus panel believes that patient\\nbehavior threatening the safety of patients and\\nstaff or the status of the program in the com-\\nmunity is grounds for patient discharge. OTP\\nadministrators may need to make difficult judg-\\nments about what constitutes threatening\\nbehavior (especially in light of deficits in inter-\\npersonal skills and possible untreated co-\\noccurring disorders) and evidence of drug deal-\\ning. But an OTPís responsibility to provide\\ngood treatment for its other patientsóindeed,\\nits responsibility to remain a viable resource in\\nthe communityórequires that these limits be\\nset and enforced.\\nFailure to pay\\nInvoluntary discharge for failure to pay treat-\\nment fees presents a more difficult ethical issue\\ninvolving the limited financial resources of\\nmany patients and the uneven public funding of\\nMAT. Patients discharged for inability to pay\\nor because their OTPs have lost funding might\\nhave been doing well, and terminating treat-\\nment, in most cases, will halt their recovery or\\nprecipitate relapse (Knight et al. 1996a).\\nAlthough involuntary discharge for failure to\\npay fees appears to violate the principles of\\nautonomy, beneficence, and nonmalfeasance,\\nthe unfortunate reality is that OTPs must oper-\\nate within fiscal constraints. If OTPs continue\\nto deliver uncompensated care, they may face\\nfinancial ruinóa consequence that would jeop-\\nardize treatment for all patients (including\\nthose who continue to pay). Nonetheless, OTPs\\nconsidering patient discharge for nonpayment\\nshould address the principle of nonmalfea-\\nsance, at least in part, by mitigating harm to\\npatients, for example, by working out payment\\nschedules, assisting with access to insurance or\\nother funding sources, or facilitating transfer to\\nlower cost facilities. In 2003, the American\\nAssociation for the Treatment of Opioid\\nDependence (AATOD) released new recommen-\\ndations addressing involuntary withdrawal\\nfrom treatment for nonpayment of fees\\n(www.dmhas.state.ct.us/opioid/\\nwithdrawal.htm).\\nFailure to respond\\nAnother difficult ethical issue occurs when an\\nOTP proposes to discharge a patient involun-\\ntarily for failure to respond to treatment.

Indeed, because research has\\nshown that discharge from MAT leads to poor\\noutcomes, by pursuing the principle of benef-\\nicence to its logical conclusion of involuntary\\ndischarge, the OTP may be putting a\\npatientís health at greater risk. The OTP\\nmay be violating the principle of nonmal-\\nfeasance as well, especially if it is unaware \\nof the possible consequences of involuntary\\ndischarge.\\nInvoluntary discharge of noncompliant\\npatients often occurs when OTPs have wait-\\ning lists. When limited slots existóbecause of\\nthe limits of public sector funding or regula-\\ntory caps on slotsóand applicants are wait-\\ning for treatment, pressure mounts to dis-\\ncharge patients who are not fully compliant\\nwith treatment regimens. Concerns about the\\nfairness of continuing to treat a patient who is\\nunwilling or unable to take full advantage of\\ntreatment appeal to the principle of justice.\\nï Not to discharge.Arguably, when treatment\\nproviders do not discharge noncompliant\\npatients but continue treating them, they risk\\nviolating the principle of beneficence because\\nthey are not providing care they believe will\\npromote patient health. By ignoring the effect\\nnoncompliant patients have on the therapeu-\\ntic milieu for other patients, providers are\\nviolating the principle of beneficence for those\\nother patients. Treatment providers who con-\\ntinue to treat noncompliant patients also vio-\\nlate the principle of justice by denying treat-\\nment to potential patients on the waiting list.\\nOTPs should decide how to respond to \\ntreatment noncompliance based on factors\\nand principles discussed above and patientsí\\nspecific circumstances.

The OTP has an ethical\\nresponsibility to consider these principles \\nand the effect of discharge on patients and\\nthe program.\\nTake-home privileges\\nThe decisions a medical director makes about\\ntake-home privileges, although not as stark as\\nthose related to involuntary termination, also\\nrequire that all four ethical principles be\\nweighed. Patients are usually interested in\\nincreasing their autonomy and ability to carry\\nout normal daily activities by reducing visits to\\ntheir OTP for medication, but the medical\\ndirector must consider what is safest for\\npatients. Take-home medication privileges\\nmight benefit a patient by reducing his or her\\nexposure to an OTPís less stable patients and\\nmaking it easier for the patient to lead a normal\\nlife, by providing an incentive to further\\nenhance recovery, and by expressing a pro-\\ngramís confidence in the patientís progress.\\nHowever, increased take-home privileges may\\npose a risk to a patient of overmedication and\\nlethal use and to people in the community of\\ndrug diversion or accidental life-threatening\\ningestion by intolerant individuals (e.g., chil-\\ndren). Federal regulations governing OTPs\\nrequire that a medical director deciding\\nwhether to allow or increase patient take-home\\nprivileges consult the principle of nonmalfea-\\nsance by considering the risk of harm to\\npatients or others (42 Code of Federal\\nRegulations, Part 8 ß 12(i)(2)).\\nThe longstanding concern with methadone\\ndiversion also is rooted in the principle of \\njustice.

TIPs are developed under CSAT’s Knowledge Application Program to improve the treatment capabilities of\\nthe Nation’s alcohol and drug abuse treatment service system.\\nWhat Is a Quick Guide?\\nA Quick Guide clearly and concisely presents the primary information from a TIP in a pocket-sized booklet. Each Quick Guide is\\ndivided into sections to help readers quickly locate relevant material. Some contain glossaries of terms or lists of resources.  Page\\nnumbers from the original TIP are referenced so providers can refer back to the source document for more information.\\nWhat Are KAP Keys?\\nAlso based on TIPs, KAP Keys are handy, durable tools. Keys may include assessment or screening instruments, checklists, and\\nsummaries of treatment phases. Printed on coated paper, each KAP Keys set is fastened together with a key ring and can be kept\\nwithin a treatment provider’s reach and consulted frequently. The Keys allow you—the busy clinician or program administrator—\\nto locate information easily and to use this information to enhance treatment services.\\n*Under revision'),\n",
